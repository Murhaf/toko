22200001	Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital, creating another potential obstacle to the government's sale of sick thrifts.
22200002	The bill, whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget.
22200003	The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization.
22200004	"Such agency `self-help' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive, far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing," said Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), the bill's chief sponsor.
22200005	The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC.
22200006	This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit.
22200007	Another $20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds, which pay lower interest rates.
22200008	But the RTC also requires "working" capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold, until the assets can be sold separately.
22200009	That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold, leaving the total spending for the bailout at $50 billion, or $166 billion including interest over 10 years.
22200010	"It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved," said David Cooke, executive director of the RTC.
22200011	The agency has already spent roughly $19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls, and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes.
22200012	Absent other working capital, he said, the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets.
22200013	"We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward," he said.
22200014	The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight.
22200015	The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $5 billion at any time.
22200016	Moreover, it says the RTC's total obligations may not exceed $50 billion, but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt, and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds.
22200017	But Congress didn't anticipate or intend more public debt, say opponents of the RTC's working-capital plan, and Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed.
22200018	"That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian," he said.
22200019	"The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility."
22200020	The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday.
22201001	We're about to see if advertising works.
22201002	Hard on the heels of Friday's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that's followed, a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message: Keep on investing, the market's just fine.
22201003	Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market, as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
22201004	Just days after the 1987 crash, major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors.
22201005	This time around, they're moving even faster.
22201006	PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night.
22201007	Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today.
22201008	Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads.
22201009	It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday.
22201010	Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies.
22201011	The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around, when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic.
22201012	This time, the firms were ready.
22201013	Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge.
22201014	When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers.
22201015	The ads touted Fidelity's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline, "Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call."
22201016	A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line, which already was operating but which many clients didn't know about, received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend.
22201017	"A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us," he says.
22201018	"To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial.
22201019	It would have been too late to think about on Friday.
22201020	We had to think about it ahead of time."
22201021	Today's Fidelity ad goes a step further, encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity.
22201022	Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility."
22201023	It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name.
22201024	PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash.
22201025	In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house, ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night.
22201026	It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute creations.
22201027	The new PaineWebber commercial, created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co., features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.
22201028	Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, "We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle. . . .
22201029	We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation."
22201030	The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night.
22201031	PaineWebber considered an even harder sell, recommending specific stocks.
22201032	Instead, it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market.
22201033	"We're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything, which just drives the prices down further," says John Lampe, PaineWebber's director of advertising.
22201034	"If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed."
22201035	He adds, "This isn't 1987 revisited."
22201036	With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday, investment firms had to constantly revise their approach.
22201037	At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon.
22201038	The plan had been to make one of Shearson's easy-to-film, black-and-white "Where We Stand" commercials, which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985.
22201039	The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow, replacing the debut commercial of Shearson's new ad campaign, "Leadership by Example."
22201040	But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday, Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad.
22201041	"We don't think at this point anything needs to be said.
22201042	The market seems to be straightening out; we're taking a wait-and-see attitude," says Cathleen B. Stewart, executive vice president of marketing.
22201043	In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987.
22201044	But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective.
22201045	In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse.
22201046	Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around.
22201047	Ad Notes. . . .
22201048	ARNOLD ADVERTISING:
22201049	Edward Eskandarian, former chairman of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS/Boston, reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising, a small Boston shop.
22201050	Terms weren't disclosed.
22201051	Mr. Eskandarian, who resigned his Della Femina post in September, becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold.
22201052	John Verret, the agency's president and chief executive, will retain the title of president.
22201053	Separately, McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., named Arnold to handle its estimated $4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford, Conn., area.
22201054	That account had been handled by Della Femina, McNamee WCRS.
22201055	EDUCATION ADS:
22201056	A 142-page ad supplement to Business Week's special "Corporate Elite" issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation's education crisis.
22201057	The supplement, the largest ever for the magazine, includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two-year Business Week initiative on education.
22201058	The magazine will distribute 10% of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers.
22202001	You know what the law of averages is, don't you?
22202002	It's what 1) explains why we are like, well, ourselves rather than Bo Jackson; 2) cautions that it's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep; and 3) predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes.
22202003	Baseball, that game of the long haul, is the quintessential sport of the mean, and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.
22202004	The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A's, the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year's tournament.
22202005	Morever, much of the damage was accomplished by A's who had some catching up to do.
22202006	In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.
22202007	He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed.
22202008	So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup.
22202009	"If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen," he later remarked.
22202010	On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.
22202011	Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.
22202012	The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision.
22202013	Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.
22202014	That he was the A's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark, plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs, indicates he may have some evening up coming, but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving, that might not be this week.
22202015	The same goes for Mike Moore, another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday's contest.
22202016	"Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before," marveled Giant manager Roger Craig.
22202017	He's an ex-hurler who's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery, which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat.
22202018	The upshot of the downshoot is that the A's go into San Francisco's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest.
22202019	The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all.
22202020	That's not an average to soothe Giant rooters.
22202021	One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART (that's a better name for a public conveyance than "Desire," don't you think?) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings, but they observe them in relative calm.
22202022	Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see.
22202023	A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams.
22202024	"I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.
22202025	I love 'em both.
22202026	The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games," said David Williams, a Sacramento septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go.
22202027	The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility.
22202028	I choose to believe it's the latter, although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else.
22202029	Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans, and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets.
22202030	Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for.
22202031	In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.
22202032	He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three-run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally.
22202033	Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season, the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph.
22202034	Not his autograph; power-hitter McGwire's.
22202035	An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation.
22202036	He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run.
22202037	"When you're in the groove, you see every ball tremendously," he lectured.
22202038	The cold guys in the set were Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams, the Giants' 3-4-5 hitters.
22202039	They combined for 25 hits, six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs.
22202040	They went a collective 5-for-24 here, with zero homers and ribbies.
22202041	It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come.
22202042	"I believe in the law of averages," declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two.
22202043	"I'd rather see a so-so hitter who's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who's cold."
22202044	But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side.
22202045	"When it goes, you never know when you'll get it back," he said.
22202046	"That's baseball.
22203001	NCR Corp. reported a 10% drop in third-quarter net income, citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip.
22203002	Net income for the quarter fell to $93.1 million from $103.1 million, roughly what analysts had expected.
22203003	But per-share profit dropped only 2% to $1.23 a share from $1.26 a share, as the company continued its stock buy-back plan.
22203004	Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million.
22203005	Revenue fell 1% to $1.39 billion from $1.41 billion.
22203006	The computer maker, which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S., also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will "adversely affect" its fourth-quarter performance and "make it difficult" to better 1988 results.
22203007	NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas, reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets.
22203008	The company, however, said orders in the U.S. showed "good gains" during the latest quarter.
22203009	Analysts estimate those gains at 12% to 13%, a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR's major customers.
22203010	In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry, NCR, which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers, is also affected by the retail and financial sectors, "areas of the economy that have generally not been robust," notes Sanjiv G. Hingorani, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.
22203011	These factors, combined with a strong dollar, should negatively affect the current quarter's results, NCR said.
22203012	In the year-earlier fourth quarter, NCR had profit of $149.6 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion.
22203013	Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $5.35 a share from $5.50 a share.
22203014	Revenue projections were slashed to $6.03 billion from $6.20 billion.
22203015	Last year, NCR had net income of $439.3 million, or $5.33 a share, on $5.99 billion in revenue.
22203016	For the nine months, the company's earnings fell 9% to $264.6 million, or $3.40 a share, from $289.7 million, or $3.49 a share.
22203017	Revenues declined 1% to $4.17 billion from $4.19 billion.
22203018	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $57.
22204001	Concerning your Sept. 19 article "Wall Street Firms Link Analysts' Pay to Performance," I'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard, cold facts of the real working world.
22204002	If the firms are serious, however, why limit the practice to the poor, maligned analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best?
22204003	Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force, and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year?
22204004	That should stop a lot of account-churning, and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern, careful thought and good sense.
22204005	Now, wouldn't that be a novelty.
22204006	Phyllis Kyle Stephenson Newport News, Va.
22205001	Steve Clark, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader, reported for work at 5 a.m., two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting.
22205002	At Jefferies & Co., J. Francis Palamara didn't reach the office until 5:30 a.m., but then he had been up most of the night at home.
22205003	"I had calls all night long from the States," he said.
22205004	"I was woken up every hour -- 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 4:30.
22205005	People are looking for possible opportunities to buy, but nobody wants to stick their chin out."
22205006	For many of London's securities traders, it was a day that started nervously in the small hours.
22205007	By lunchtime, the selling was at near-panic fever.
22205008	But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally, the City breathed a sigh of relief.
22205009	So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London's financial district.
22205010	In the wake of Wall Street's plunge last Friday, the London market was considered especially vulnerable.
22205011	And before the opening of trading here yesterday, all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be.
22205012	By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m., the news from Asia was in.
22205013	And it left mixed signals for London.
22205014	Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8% on thin volume; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5% in orderly trading.
22205015	At Jefferies' trading room on Finsbury Circus, a stately circle at the edge of the financial district, desktop computer screens displayed the London market's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index.
22205016	Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks; blue figures, rising stocks.
22205017	Right away, the reds outnumbered the blues, 80 to 20, as the index opened at 2076.8, off 157.1 points, or 7%.
22205018	"I see concern, but I don't see any panic," said Mr. Palamara, a big, good-humored New York native who runs the 15-trader office.
22205019	The Jefferies office, a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm, played it conservatively, seeking to avoid risk.
22205020	"This is not the sort of market to have a big position in," said David Smith, who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks.
22205021	"We tend to run a very tight book."
22205022	Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers, and there weren't many buyers.
22205023	"All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle, B.A.T, DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning," Mr. Smith said.
22205024	Seconds later, a 7,500-share "sell" order for Scottish & Newcastle came in.
22205025	For the third time in 15 minutes, a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette.
22205026	On the screens, only two forlorn blue figures remained, but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140.
22205027	"Because Tokyo didn't collapse, let's pick up a little stock," Mr. Smith said.
22205028	He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers' price quotes.
22205029	The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence, ($13.27) and Mr. Smith's traders started putting out feelers.
22205030	But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling, and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence.
22205031	"When I want to buy, they run from you -- they keep changing their prices," Mr. Smith said.
22205032	"It's very frustrating."
22205033	He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares.
22205034	By this time, it was 4:30 a.m. in New York, and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market, which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday's New York market break.
22205035	"Fundamentally dangerous. . . ," Mr. Smith said, almost in a whisper, ". . . .fundamentally weak . . . fairly vulnerable still . . . extremely dangerously poised . . .
22205036	we're in for a lot of turbulence. . . ."
22205037	He was right.
22205038	By midday, the London market was in full retreat.
22205039	"It's falling like a stone," said Danny Linger, a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
22205040	Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby.
22205041	Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television.
22205042	At 12:49 p.m., the index hit its low, 2029.7, off 204.2 points.
22205043	"France opened the limit down, off at least 10% if you could calculate the index, which you couldn't," Mr. Clark, the Shearson trader, said early in the afternoon.
22205044	"Spain is down 10% and suspended, Sweden's down 8%, Norway 11%.
22205045	This market has been very badly damaged."
22205046	As 2:30 p.m. -- Wall Street's opening time -- neared, Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open.
22205047	In the center of the trading floor, chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes.
22205048	They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off.
22205049	As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC, Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K.
22205050	Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar.
22205051	Suddenly, after about 45 minutes, the U.S. markets rallied.
22205052	"The MMI has gone better," shouted one trader at about 3:15 London time, as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout.
22205053	As Wall Street strengthened, the London trading room went wild.
22205054	Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street.
22205055	Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day.
22205056	"Rally! Rally! Rally!" shouted Shearson trader Andy Rosen, selling more Jaguar shares.
22205057	"This is panic buying!"
22205058	As the London market rallied, some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it.
22205059	The London index closed at 2163.4, its high for the day, off 70.5, or about 3.3%.
22206001	Ambassador Paul Nitze's statement (Notable & Quotable, Sept. 20), "If you have a million people working for you, every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year," is a pretty negative way of looking at things.
22206002	Isn't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you, every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year?
22206003	Don't be such a pessimist, Mr. Ambassador.

22207001	The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines.
22207002	The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, spurred quick action on the legislation, introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday.
22207003	The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow, and a floor vote by next week will be urged.
22207004	The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump, who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines.
22207005	In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar (D., Minn.), Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR, and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal.
22207006	Elaine Chao, deputy transportation secretary, also sent a letter to express the administration's opposition to the bill "in its present form."
22207007	Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump's allegations as an "excuse for his own deal failing."
22207008	He also said the fact that the other letter hadn't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is "wiggle room" in the administration's position.
22207009	Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation wasn't a response to any particular market situation.
22207010	But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation.
22207011	Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR isn't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation.
22207012	"It's still on the fast track and we still want to do it," said one Senate aide.
22207013	The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out.
22207014	Currently, the transportation secretary doesn't have clearly established authority to block mergers, but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit.
22207015	Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process, and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry.
22207016	In general, the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15% or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired.
22207017	It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition.
22207018	The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information hasn't been provided, or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially, result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets, or give control to a foreign interest.
22207019	If more information is needed, the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days.
22207020	All the witnesses, both congressmen and industry experts, expressed support for the bill in order to prevent profiteers from cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe, cost-effective service.
22207021	But several committee members disapproved, some backing Mr. Trump's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge.
22207022	One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin-off companies.
22208001	In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members, a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow.
22208002	"It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one," said Doug Hammond, the mediator, who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a resumption of negotiations.
22208003	"We're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that, we have made no expression of expectations," a Boeing spokesman said.
22208004	The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus some bonuses.
22208005	Currently, average pay for machinists is $13.39 an hour, Boeing said.
22208006	Now in its 13th day, the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some jetliners.
22208007	With a strike fund of about $100 million, the union had said it was prepared for a long strike.
22208008	After the third week on strike, union members will begin receiving $100 a week from the fund.
22208009	Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines.
22208010	And at the company's Wichita, Kan., plant, about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working, Boeing said.
22208011	Under Kansas right-to-work laws, contracts cannot require workers to be union members.
22208012	Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant Renton, Wash., plant.
22208013	Union officials couldn't be reached for comment.
22209001	DPC Acquisition Partners, a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp., said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker's common stock.
22209002	DPC, a group led by the New York investment firm Crescott Inc., also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts' board.
22209003	DPC holds a 7.8% stake in Dataproducts and made a $15-a-share bid for the company in May, but Dataproducts management considered the $283.7 million proposal unacceptable.
22209004	A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group's new plan.
22209005	In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $9.375.
22209006	Dataproducts, which had been seeking a buyer for several months, announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block.
22209007	The company's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors, to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary.
22209008	As part of the plan, Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $63 million of its real estate holdings to Trizec Properties Inc., a unit of Canada's Trizec Corp.
22209009	Jack Davis, Dataproducts' president, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company "is at a loss to understand DPC's intentions."
22209010	He called today's announcement "opportunistic and disruptive" and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring.
22210001	Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday's New York sell-off, but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout.
22210002	European investors have further reason for optimism today, after the U.S. rebound.
22210003	The Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which closed before the New York exchanges opened, was the hardest hit of the major European markets, with the DAX Index dropping 12.8%.
22210004	In London, prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9% before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2%.
22210005	West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said, "In my view, the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly.
22210006	There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions, but they aren't based on fundamentals.
22210007	The economy of West Germany and the EC {European Community} is highly stable."
22210008	Paris, which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks, also was hard hit.
22210009	Share prices fell in Milan, Amsterdam, Zurich, Madrid and Stockholm.
22210010	Prices in Brussels, where a computer breakdown disrupted trading, also tumbled.
22210011	Following is a breakdown of major market activity:
22210012	FRANKFURT:
22210013	One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe's strongest economy.
22210014	The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8%, a one-day record, wiping out the summer's gains.
22210015	The index closed at 1385.72, down 203.56 points.
22210016	By comparison, two years ago on Black Monday, the new index would have dropped 9.4%, according to a projection by the exchange.
22210017	Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange's losing 35% of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake.
22210018	This time, however, many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly.
22210019	"They all went in the wrong direction," said Andreas Insam, an investment adviser for the Bank in Liechtenstein's Frankfurt branch.
22210020	He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10%.
22210021	After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders, Frankfurt's normal two-hour trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume.
22210022	"The beginning was chaotic," said Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank AG.
22210023	"It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market."
22210024	Institutional investors and bankers, many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets, were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8% decline in Tokyo stock prices.
22210025	"Everybody was still confident, including most institutional investors.
22210026	That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors," said Norbert Braeuer, a senior trader for Hessische Landesbank.
22210027	Some big institutions, including banks, began picking up lower-priced shares late yesterday, but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting.
22210028	But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize, analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange, which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of 1657.61 on Sept. 8.
22210029	Some of West Germany's bluest chips took some of the biggest hits.
22210030	A 16.3% drop for Mannesmann AG and Dresdner Bank AG's 9.6% decline were especially problematic for their respective boards, whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in jeopardy.
22210031	Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks ($642.2 million) by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each.
22210032	Yet yesterday's market cropped Dresdner's share price by 33 marks to 309 marks a share, leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market recovers quickly.
22210033	LONDON:
22210034	Headed toward a record drop at midday, the London stock market recouped two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York's early rally.
22210035	The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off 70.5 points, at 2163.4, its high for the day, after having plunged 204.2 points at 12:49 p.m.
22210036	It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group, Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that spearheaded the rally.
22210037	Attracted by low prices and encouraged by New York's performance, they scooped up equities across the board.
22210038	Volume was 959.3 million shares, more than triple recent levels.
22210039	PARIS:
22210040	Late buying gave the Paris Bourse a parachute after its free fall early in the day.
22210041	The CAC General Index ended down 5.4% at 523.6, a drop of 29.6 points from Friday.
22210042	"There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before," said Michel Vigier, a partner in brokerage firm Cholet Dupont.
22210043	"When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening, there was panic buying in Paris."
22210044	Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up, traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in mid-conversation, ordering buys instead.
22210045	Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators, with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day.
22210046	When Wall Street turned, however, the big boys entered the market, looking for bargains.
22211001	J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter, while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled, and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10%.
22211002	J.P. Morgan & Co.
22211003	J.P. Morgan, as expected, posted a $1.82 billion net loss for the quarter, reflecting the New York bank's decision last month to add $2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries.
22211004	The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves.
22211005	The latest quarter's loss equals $9.92 a share.
22211006	In the year-earlier quarter, Morgan earned $233.6 million, or $1.25 a share.
22211007	George M. Salem, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., called the results "mildly disappointing."
22211008	Excluding the $2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid, earnings were about 65 cents a share, Mr. Salem said.
22211009	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Morgan climbed $1.50 a share to $44.125.
22211010	Net interest income sank 27% in the quarter to $254 million from $347 million.
22211011	The interest rate on short-term funds, which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers, was "sharply higher," Morgan said.
22211012	Morgan received $2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans; had they been accruing interest, net interest income would have been $35 million higher in the quarter, Morgan said.
22211013	Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing, costing the bank $10 million of interest income in the third period.
22211014	Income from sources other than interest climbed 12% to $414 million, reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities.
22211015	"These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related" income, the bank said.
22211016	Non-interest expenses grew 16% to $496 million.
22211017	NCNB Corp.
22211018	NCNB Corp.'s net income more than doubled in the period, largely because of continued strong performance by the bank's Texas operations.
22211019	The Charlotte, N.C., company said earnings rose to $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, from $58.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.
22211020	The latest quarter included a gain of $56.1 million, or 59 cents a share, related to the purchase of the remaining 51% of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
22211021	The strong performance, however, contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB's problem loans, particularly in the Southeast.
22211022	In the third quarter, nonperforming assets jumped to $474.1 million, or 1.43% of net loans and leases, from $232.8 million, or 1.13% in the second quarter.
22211023	Nonperformers totaled $230.8 million, or 1.27% in the year-ago third quarter.
22211024	Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $33 million loan, which NCNB said it "expects to be fully repaid, with no loss, early in the fourth quarter."
22211025	The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17% in NCNB's Southeast operations, as well as a 28% growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign.
22211026	The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38% from 3.80% a year earlier.
22211027	In Big Board composite trading yesterday, NCNB jumped $3.50 a share, to $51.
22211028	Results were released after the market closed.
22211029	NCNB Texas National, formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, contributed $76.9 million to NCNB's bottom line in the third quarter.
22211030	NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100% of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1.
22211031	NCNB raised some $1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase, and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise.
22211032	Last week, the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio, Texas, for $169.4 million.
22211033	In the first nine months, NCNB's net income climbed 65% to $310.9 million, or $3.30 a share, from $188.2 million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier.
22211034	Security Pacific Corp.
22211035	Security Pacific's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter, but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10% increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans.
22211036	Net rose to $185.1 million, or $1.55 a share, from $167.9 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier.
22211037	The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $54 million increase in net interest income, reflecting a 33% increase in real estate loans (mainly residential), and a 19% rise in consumer loans.
22211038	These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans, which were allowed to decrease.
22211039	As a result, Security Pacific's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points, a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California, which have been reporting more sluggish earnings.
22211040	Security Pacific shares closed at $44.625, down 37.5 cents, in Big Board composite trading.
22211041	The earnings represent a 0.89% return on assets for Security Pacific, and an 18.9% return on equity.
22211042	The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market.
22211043	Security Pacific reported a 33% increase in net credit losses for the quarter, to $109 million from $81.9 million in the year-ago period.
22211044	Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $1.75 billion at Sept. 30, from $1.7 billion a year ago.
22211045	Security Pacific's loan-loss provision was down 22%, or $30.4 million, because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before.
22211046	Non-interest income fell 6% in the quarter, mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations.
22211047	Non-interest expense grew only 4% in the period.
22211048	For the nine months, net rose 17% to $548.9 million, or $4.67 a share, from $469.4 million, or $4.13 a share, a year earlier.
22212001	LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it won't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer.
22212002	The new offer, which seeks 50.3% of the cellular and broadcasting concern, is for $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares.
22212003	McCaw's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN.
22212004	LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer, which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses.
22212005	BellSouth has notified LIN that it would "shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted."
22212006	The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that "guarantees" private market value after five years for the remaining shares.
22212007	McCaw has "no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain," the LIN board said.
22212008	The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN's operations and could, "therefore, operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years."
22212009	In national over-the-counter trading, LIN closed at $104.75, down $2.75.
22213001	A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co.'s $18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is "grossly inadequate."
22213002	In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares, or about 4.7% of the shares outstanding, said " . . . at present none of us believes an offer for less than $25 per share would be fair and some believe that $25 is too low."
22213003	The letter was dated Oct. 6.
22213004	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telerate shares closed yesterday at $18.875, down 75 cents a share.
22213005	Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has launched an $18-a-share, or $576 million, tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding; Dow Jones owns 67% of Telerate.
22213006	Telerate has rejected the offer, which expires Nov. 3.
22213007	The group includes Putnam Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston; Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco; the California Public Employees Retirement System, Sacramento, Calif., and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Baltimore.
22213008	Among other issues, the group's letter said it has "concerns as to whether Dow Jones's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness."
22213009	A spokesman for Dow Jones said he hadn't seen the group's filing, but added, "obviously Dow Jones disagrees with their conclusions.
22213010	Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $18 a share.
22214001	U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian "free trade" agreement has ruled that Canada's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord.
22214002	Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute.
22214003	If a solution isn't reached by then, she said, the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.
22214004	However, in Ottawa, Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the "legitimacy of Canada's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries."
22214005	Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel's report, an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions "are illegal."
22214006	The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions.
22214007	Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export.
22214008	This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds.
22214009	Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument.
22214010	"We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel's ruling" that the "landing requirement" also must be ended, she said.
22214011	Earlier, an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules.
22214012	Mrs. Hills said the U.S. won't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season's catch.
22214013	She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded.

22216001	BancOklahoma Corp. said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., creditor banks and subordinated debenture holders.
22216002	The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and debenture obligations through exchanges of cash and equity.
22216003	The FDIC, which in 1986 provided $130 million in open-bank assistance to BancOklahoma's Bank of Oklahoma, Tulsa, unit will continue to maintain $90 million in preferred stock in the Tulsa bank unit.
22216004	In exchange for the other $40 million, the FDIC will receive additional warrants entitling it to buy 60% of BancOklahoma's common stock outstanding, up from the 55% option the FDIC received under terms of the 1986 capital infusion.
22216005	In exchange for the $76 million they are owed, creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of BancOklahoma common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers, the bank holding company said.
22216006	Also under the agreement, debenture holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $7.7 million in debentures and holders of BancOklahoma's series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own, the company said.
22217001	Bear Stearns's chief economist, Lawrence Kudlow, in the Sept. 29 issue of the firm's Global Spectator:
22217002	Were it true that a weak currency paves the way for trade surpluses, then presumably Argentina would be the center of today's global economy.
22218001	BSN Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $16.6 million in 7 3/4% convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants.
22218002	Under terms of the offer, the sporting goods maker will swap $9 face amount of 9 1/4% subordinated notes due 1996 and one warrant for each common share.
22218003	Each warrant allows the holder to buy one BSN share for $10.75 a share at any time over the next seven years.
22218004	BSN currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding.
22218005	BSN also is offering $850 face amount of new notes and 64 common-stock warrants for each $1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding.
22218006	The company said it can redeem the warrants at its option for $1 each.
22218007	The offer isn't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged.
22218008	BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value.
22218009	If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, BSN will increase its debt by $9 million, but it also will recognize a $2 million gain from retiring the old debt, said Michael J. Blumenfeld, president.
22218010	"We have sufficient cash flow to handle that," he said.
22218011	The offers are scheduled to expire in mid to late November.
22219001	Merrill Lynch & Co.'s net income dropped 37%, while Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 7.5% gain in net, and PaineWebber Group Inc.'s profit fell, but would have risen without a special gain a year ago.
22219002	At Merrill Lynch, third-period net was $41 million, or 34 cents a share, down from $65.6 million, or 58 cents a share, a year ago.
22219003	Total revenue reached $2.83 billion, up 10% from $2.57 billion.
22219004	The firm's drop in net reflected weaker revenue in transactions for its own account -- a decline of 19% to $314.6 million on reduced revenue from trading fixed-income securities.
22219005	Investment banking revenue fell 22% to $296.6 million on fewer equity and municipal underwritings.
22219006	Merrill Lynch's commission revenue grew 21%, however, to $462.8 million, on higher share prices and volume and on strong sales of mutual funds.
22219007	Revenue derived from interest and dividends jumped 30% to $1.4 billion.
22219008	Asset-management fee revenue grew 12% to $151 million.
22219009	The brokerage also reported a loss of $2.2 million from the discontinued operations and disposal of its Fine Homes International Limited Partnership real-estate subsidiary.
22219010	Bear Stearns said net in the first quarter ended Sept. 29 reached $22.1 million, or 23 cents a share, from $20.5 million, or 20 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
22219011	Gross revenue rose 21% to $580.4 million from $478.9 million.
22219012	Profit from trading for its own account dropped, the securities firm said.
22219013	Investment banking revenue climbed 25%, while commission revenue advanced 31% on a stronger retail market.
22219014	Bear Stearns is the holding company for Bear, Stearns & Co., the investment banking and brokerage firm.
22219015	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Bear Stearns shares closed at $13.625, down 25 cents.
22219016	Separately, PaineWebber posted net income for the third quarter of $16.8 million, or 41 cents a share, reflecting a "broad-based improvement" in the company's core businesses.
22219017	Retail profit surged, but the company said it was only a "modest contributor" to third-quarter results.
22219018	A year ago, net at the New York investment banking firm was $20.9 million, or 50 cents a share, including a special pretax gain of $46.3 million from the sale of the company's interest in National Car Rental Systems Inc.
22219019	Revenue was $444.9 million, including net interest, down slightly from $450.7 million.
22219020	In Big Board composite trading yesterday, PaineWebber closed at $18.50, up 75 cents.
22220001	Seafirst Corp. said it signed an agreement with builder Martin Selig to purchase its headquarters building, the Columbia Seafirst Center, for $354 million.
22220002	Purchase of the 76-story structure is subject to execution of a definitive agreement, approval by the boards of Seafirst and its parent company BankAmerica Corp., and approval by regulators.
22221001	The market upheaval apparently hasn't triggered any cash crunch -- yet.
22221002	Individual investors, investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans.
22221003	But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties.
22221004	"We're seeing nothing out of the ordinary," said one official at a Top 10 bank.
22221005	"That's good news, because we all swim in this water."
22221006	Added another executive at a big bank: "We were all a little goosey over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen {Monday}, but it's been very quiet.
22221007	Now, as for tomorrow, hell, who knows?
22222001	What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices.
22222002	No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling.
22222003	But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency.
22222004	After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose.
22222005	The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.
22222006	The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels.
22222007	It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic.
22222008	A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself.
22222009	But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices.
22222010	What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds.
22222011	The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes, after the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points, or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index.
22222012	Options markets stopped trading in many securities.
22222013	The New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, remained open.
22222014	With nowhere else to go, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange.
22222015	As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply.
22222016	Had the futures and options markets been open, additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline, most probably, would have been less intense.
22222017	At 3:30, after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington, the futures exchanges reopened.
22222018	Futures trading, however, was halted altogether at 3:45, after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points, which is the daily limit for price declines.
22222019	At this point, the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange.
22222020	It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange, the futures markets and the options markets, though physically separate, have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively.
22222021	Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them.
22222022	It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers.
22222023	To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility, either all markets should be open to trading or none.
22222024	Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday, but they probably would have made for smoother, less volatile executions.
22222025	It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open.
22222026	Let's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline.
22222027	The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets.
22222028	The new circuit breakers, if they are to be applied at all, will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open.
22222029	The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies.
22222030	Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (which, with the SEC, regulates the Chicago stock-index markets) be unable to agree, the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary.
22222031	In many ways, our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago.
22222032	The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day.
22222033	Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers, and specialists -- who I believe should stay, despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions.
22222034	(Of course, specialists' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices.
22222035	Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders.)
22222036	But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished.
22222037	Mr. Freund, former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange, is a professor of economics at Pace University's business school in New York.
22223001	A UNIFIED EUROPE poses labor problems and prospects for U.S. firms.
22223002	The "social dimension" -- worker concerns -- of the European Community's plan to open its internal borders in 1992 could set the effort "off the rails" if not done reasonably, says General Electric senior vice president Frank Doyle.
22223003	U.S. companies wanting to expand in Europe face "tough pressure" from unions in nations such as West Germany, which play a big consulting role in management decisions, he says.
22223004	FMC Corp. and Baxter International say unions also won't like plant relocations and needed restructuring, which means layoffs.
22223005	Many employers have already begun moving to southern countries such as Spain and Italy, where wages are low and unions are weaker; demand for trained labor and managers will rise there, FMC says.
22223006	Pfizer, Fluor and GE see big "EC 92" pluses: a push for job training and ease in moving and finding workers.
22223007	CLUBBING A FAN wasn't the Baltimore Orioles' fault.
22223008	So said a federal judge, in a case involving two players for the minor league Bluefield, Va., Orioles, a Baltimore farm team.
22223009	The players were heckled by a patron during a July 4, 1988, game with the Martinsville Phillies.
22223010	Like its parent that year, "Bluefield was not having a good year," the judge said.
22223011	After the game ("Bluefield lost, 9-8, stranding three runners in . . . the ninth," he noted), trouble began.
22223012	More taunting in the parking lot, the players said, led to a fight.
22223013	The fan said he was punched and kicked by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat.
22223014	The judge dismissed the fan's suit against the team, however, ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring, and not responsible for a fight that was outside the players' employment.
22223015	PROPOSALS ARISE for coping with the shortage of nurses.
22223016	An Association of Academic Health Centers report urges freeing nurses from duties that don't require special skills.
22223017	It also recommends better retirement and day-care benefits, and basing pay on education, experience and nurses' demanding work schedules.
22223018	But it opposes an American Medical Association proposal for creating a "registered care technologist," as "potentially divisive"; it says the job would entail an unwanted new doctor's "bedside" extension.
22223019	Over a third of 618 hospitals surveyed by consultant Hewitt Associates use a "clinical ladder," basing advancement on performance and education.
22223020	Many also use recruiting bonuses, tuition reimbursement, loan repayment or child-care help.
22223021	Some give lump-sum incentives.
22223022	MRA Staffing Systems signs up nurses for paid travel, promising annual income up to $50,000 and free or subsidized housing.
22223023	TREATING EMPLOYEES with respect is crucial for managers, says consultant Hay Group after surveys of a million workers.
22223024	It's in their top five "work values."
22223025	Fully 80% of employees who say their bosses treat them with respect, but only a third of those who don't feel respected say they're satisfied with where they work.
22223026	SPRUCING UP THE DIGS: About 200 employees of the Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development for four months painted walls, polished and carpeted floors, bought plants, cleaned windows and blinds, and hung pictures at the agency's Baltimore office.
22223027	The 3,000 hours of work will save the state $55,000.
22223028	CURBING WAGE BOOSTS will get high priority again in 1990 collective bargaining, a Bureau of National Affairs survey of 250 companies with pacts expiring next year indicates.
22223029	Despite labor-shortage warnings, 80% aim for first-year wage increases of under 4%; and 77% say they'd try to replace workers, if struck, or would consider it.
22223030	TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations, the National Association of Temporary Services says; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82% with more than a high-school education, and 31% with college degrees.
22223031	About 12% have retired from a full-time job, while 54% were asked to stay on full time.
22223032	HOME-SALE LOSSES rise, but they're often covered by employers.
22223033	But they search for ways to limit the damage.
22223034	A third of 439 companies surveyed by the Employee Relocation Council report a rise in 1988 sales losses over 1987.
22223035	About 72% reimburse for all or some losses.
22223036	Since 1984, more companies give sales-loss aid, as many real-estate values depreciated, the council says.
22223037	RJR Nabisco pays up to $30,000 of losses, including improvements.
22223038	Goodrich won't ensure loss coverage, but will prevent a "catastrophic loss"; it has given some employees the full purchase price when values fell from concern over dangers posed by a disposal site.
22223039	Federal Express, Dow Chemical, Ford and National City Corp. will buy the home or let the worker sell to an outside firm, but usually won't cover a loss.
22223040	Since 1984, firms offering prepurchase house appraisals, to deter overpaying, rose to 40% of those the council polled, from 28%.
22223041	THE CHECKOFF: The National Academy of Engineering gives two inventors of the semiconductor microchip a $350,000 achievement award. . . .
22223042	Now, that's reactionary: Letter Carriers union president Vincent Sombrotto accuses Philadelphia postmaster Charles James of "12th century . . . oppressive management tactics.
22224001	Yesterday was, in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr., just your "reasonably normal, 400 million-share, up 88-points day."
22224002	When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery, Big Board officials were self-congratulatory about how well the day had gone.
22224003	They said the exchange's trading procedures, personnel, equipment and links with other exchanges couldn't have performed better.
22224004	"We had no operating problems at all," Mr. Phelan said after the market closed.
22224005	"All the things that we set up to slow down the process, to let people know that the market was in an extreme position, worked extremely well."
22224006	Prices for the 416.3 million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange's trading tape with barely a delay, officials said.
22224007	While reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday, the volume was still well within the 600 million-share capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash.
22224008	The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to quell free falls in stock and futures prices weren't triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day.
22224009	Despite traders' complaints, Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday's rout to provide a cooling-off period.
22224010	Of greater help, the Big Board chairman said, was the "natural circuit breaker" of the weekend, that provided a breathing period that "brought rationality back to the market.
22225001	Chicken Chains Ruffled By Loss of Customers
22225002	FAST-FOOD chicken chains, faced with a worsening business slump, are struggling to hatch some new marketing strategies.
22225003	The Crest Report, which tracks consumer purchases, says customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10% in the second quarter, while the overall fast-food customer count was down 2%.
22225004	Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery-store convenience food, home-delivered pizza and other takeout fare, says a spokesman for the report, a publication of NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
22225005	The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems.
22225006	Church's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken Inc., which have merged, are still troubled by overlapping restaurant locations.
22225007	Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald's Corp., which introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken.
22225008	New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd.
22225009	And the chain is testing products that aren't fried, such as "char-grilled" chicken, to try to win health-conscious consumers.
22225010	Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home-delivery of chicken, which could be a hit with stay-at-home diners.
22225011	But some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping chicken warm and fresh must be solved first.
22225012	A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman, however, disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued.
22225013	He says the test is continuing in Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, and a few other cities.
22225014	The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency.
22225015	But the company declines to comment.
22225016	Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst, predicts Kentucky Fried Chicken will post an 11% drop in 1989 net income.
22225017	"They've been laggard," he says, "but they'll have to become more aggressive."
22225018	Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft-Sell Spots
22225019	CALL IT un-advertising.
22225020	Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who want exposure yet shun pushy ads.
22225021	His ploy: 60-second radio spots that offer helpful hints.
22225022	The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot.
22225023	The messages resemble the Business Traveler, a daily dose of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities.
22225024	New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates, a Butler, Pa., architectural firm.
22225025	Its radio series features such spots as "Floodlights: Evening Wear for Urban Structures" and "Building a Place to Park."
22225026	A harder sell, says John Kosar, the firm's president, would "detract from the profession."
22225027	Hospitals have signed up to use the messages to promote fundraisers, and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format to offer energy tips to consumers.
22225028	But such spots can be too soft.
22225029	"There's always a risk of lost messages," says John Fitzgerald, chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA, which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank.
22225030	"It's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition."
22225031	Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
22225032	HERE'S a retailer that's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products.
22225033	Big Bear Supermarkets Inc., a grocery chain based in San Diego, plans to display shelf cards and distribute pamphlets recommending products deemed safe for the environment.
22225034	The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners.
22225035	But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements.
22225036	For example, it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list.
22225037	That doesn't thrill Procter & Gamble Co., maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent.
22225038	A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list, noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents.
22225039	In fact, Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach, even though it isn't listed on the label for the powder version.
22225040	Thomas G. Dahlen, Big Bear's executive vice president, said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems.
22225041	"Our intent is to promote the best alternative," he says.
22225042	"And it's important that we be accurate."
22225043	But in the end, customers' wishes are what will prevail.
22225044	Big Bear doesn't care for disposable diapers, which aren't biodegradable.
22225045	Yet parents demand them.
22225046	Says Mr. Dahlen, "We'll still be forced to sell items we might not philosophically agree with."
22225047	Odds and Ends
22225048	NEATNESS does count -- at least in the grocery store.
22225049	A study by Safeway's Scanner Marketing Research shows soap sales climbed 5% when bars were neatly stacked on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket. . . .
22225050	Which celebrity endorsers are most believable?
22225051	For the third year in a row, consumers voted Bill Cosby first and James Garner second in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials, according to Video Storyboard Tests, New York.
22225052	Michael J. Fox replaced Bruce Willis in third place; Cher placed fourth for the second time.
22226001	Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general, Bush administration officials said.
22226002	If she is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop, who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues.
22226003	Dr. Novello, an expert on pediatric kidney diseases, is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
22226004	She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
22226005	Dr. Novello's office said she wouldn't talk with reporters, and it refused to release any information about her.
22226006	The newsletter Medicine & Health, which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan, said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.
22227001	The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork-barrel politics.
22227002	Nevertheless, lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending.
22227003	Kent Colton, NAHB executive vice president, argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers, increased homelessness, and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be "very difficult" to solve "without expanded federal resources."
22227004	There's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending.
22227005	But the NAHB was created in 1943 out of an organization that made its name fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal to take over all defense housing production.
22227006	Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer's coalition, pushing for such initiatives as the balanced-budget amendment.
22227007	Yet on matters close to, er, home . . .
22227008	"The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70% since 1980," argues Mr. Colton.
22227009	"We've taken more than our fair share.
22227010	I wouldn't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit."
22227011	But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs.
22227012	It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures.
22227013	Moreover, explains one HUD official, the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production.
22227014	The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish-list, which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $15 billion annually.
22227015	It would like to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95% of the median price in a particular market, instead of limiting it to $101,250; reduce (or even eliminate) FHA down-payment requirements and increase the availability of variable-rate mortgages; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program; provide "adequate" funding for the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA); increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing, including $4 billion in block grants to states and localities; and "fully fund" the McKinney Act, a $656 million potpourri for the homeless.
22227016	Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past, and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists, as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal, or congressmen.
22227017	Indirect subsidies, through the FHA, for instance, are little better.
22227018	Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in "no cost to the government," the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low-income) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense.
22227019	More important, housing programs run by HUD, the VA, and FmHA are awash in red ink.
22227020	The FHA alone lost $4.2 billion in fiscal 1988; the government's equity in the agency, essentially its reserve fund, fell to minus $2.9 billion.
22227021	The federal government has had to pump in $2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $120 million for the fiscal year just ended.
22227022	All told, the federal government already guarantees more than $900 billion of mortgages.
22227023	In its nicely produced publication "Where Will Our Children Live?" the NAHB does acknowledge that "of course, the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided by the federal government."
22227024	It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people.
22227025	But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to, say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls.
22227026	The association, a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year, is like many other business lobbies.
22227027	Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union: "It treads in two worlds.
22227028	The builders like the subsidies, but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues, such as the balanced-budget amendment."
22227029	Unfortunately, the organization's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility.
22227030	Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $19 billion omnibus housing bill, the organization "basically dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition," says Ms. MacDonald.
22227031	As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges: "Government is not going to solve the problem. . . .
22227032	The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down."
22227033	More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies.
22227034	Is this what the home builders want?

22228001	In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency, EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome.
22228002	According to diplomatic sources in Brussels, most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9.
22228003	The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is opposed to creating a single EC currency.
22228004	But the process of convening the intergovernmental conference doesn't require unanimity.
22228005	Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself, but could be viewed as an important psychological push.
22228006	French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
22228007	Diplomatic sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity.
22229001	The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade.
22229002	When asked "What went wrong?" the unfortunate victim replied, "It was a combination of things."
22229003	And so it was on Gray Friday.
22229004	The grand marshal of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage.
22229005	Even if that is so, however, it's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected to stop the procession before the end of the rout(e).
22229006	The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing.
22229007	Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer, consisting of less cash, the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending.
22229008	Lots of other entries made up the parade, of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices, signalling Federal Reserve tightness; and the Bush administration's (temporary?) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax.
22229009	As usual, few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders, although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write.
22229010	What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street, however, was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason, the pool of debt capital is drying up.
22229011	Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the "deal" stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing.
22229012	Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses.
22229013	UAL, which triggered the slide, opened Monday at $224, down about 20% from Thursday's close.
22229014	AMR opened Monday at $80, down nearly 20% from Thursday's close.
22229015	(Both took further hits yesterday.)
22229016	Hilton lost 20% on Friday; Paramount lost almost 11%.
22229017	A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured, the target's stock price was not affected on Friday.
22229018	The multibillion-dollar prospects, where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and/or issue billions in high-yield debt, were where the damage was concentrated.
22229019	The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday's dramatic march for several weeks.
22229020	The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers, such as Resorts International, Integrated Resources, and Campeau's retailing empire, have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities.
22229021	Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring.
22229022	As a result, high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times.
22229023	These are all market excesses (putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity), and what we've seen is the market reining them in.
22229024	Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday.
22229025	If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday, what are the implications for policy makers?
22229026	After all, the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators.
22229027	Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington's bashing of Wall Street?
22229028	Absolutely not.
22229029	To the extent that Friday's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage, the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior.
22229030	The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings.
22229031	The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate.
22229032	If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions.
22229033	Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year.
22229034	Not surprisingly, he sometimes bites.
22229035	The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday, while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily.
22229036	If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington.
22229037	If you side with the arbitragers and raiders, you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators, although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated.
22229038	The truth is, Washington understands politics better than economics.
22229039	Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging, actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm.
22229040	Any such attempt to distinguish "good debt" from "bad debt," or to draw the line at a particular industry, such as the airlines, is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general.
22229041	Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs, Panama and the deficit, all of them parades that seem never to end.

22230001	Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning, with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38.
22230002	The index slid 647.33 points, or 1.8%, on Monday.
22230003	In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points, to 35133.83.
22230004	By 10 a.m. Tokyo time, the index was up 435.11 points, to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York's overnight rally.
22230005	Monday's slide came in a relatively calm session that didn't provide much direction for other markets.
22230006	Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe, particularly in Frankfurt, although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York.
22230007	Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo, but the selling wave stopped short of precipitating another market crash.
22230008	All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday's 190.58-point plunge on Wall Street.
22230009	But rather than set the tone for other markets, Japan's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines.
22230010	Still, despite the sudden reappearance of stock-market turbulence, managers of Japanese investment funds said they weren't planning to unload U.S. or European equities.
22230011	"We didn't trade much today, as our policy now is to wait and see," said a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co.
22230012	"We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York."
22230013	The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary, and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that.
22230014	But in the absence of panicky trading, its presence was never overtly felt.
22230015	At the close, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69, down 647.33 points, or 1.8%.
22230016	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66, or 1.7%, to 2600.88.
22230017	The day's decline was generally in line with analysts' weekend predictions.
22230018	Declining issues swamped advancers, 941-105.
22230019	But volume was thin at 526.2 million shares, compared with 574.7 million Friday.
22230020	The market opened sharply lower, with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes.
22230021	A midmorning rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session, but the rally failed in the afternoon, and the market closed near the day's low.
22230022	The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year.
22230023	The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96, or 2.7%, to 3655.40.
22230024	Many investors, trying to outperform the market's major indexes, have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks.
22230025	Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market didn't fall more sharply.
22230026	But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago, during the October 1987 global stock market crash.
22230027	On Oct. 16, 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6%, and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4% drop.
22230028	This time, Wall Street's plunge of 6.9% Friday was followed by yesterday's 1.8% loss in Tokyo.
22230029	Two years ago, Tokyo's biggest fall came the day after New York's 22.6% Black Monday plunge, when the Nikkei average fell 14.9%.
22230030	Thus, market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street's opening.
22230031	But in New York yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares, although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market.
22230032	Nobuto Yasuda, a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co., called yesterday's session "a good scenario" for Japan.
22230033	"Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders," he said.
22230034	"For us institutional investors, the chance for buying has come."
22230035	Isao Ushikubo, general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co., also was optimistic.
22230036	He described Friday's plunge in the U.S. as a "fleeting" event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity.
22230037	"Unless there is a panic, this is the best time to buy, as was the case two years ago," he said.
22230038	"Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water, but as far as major stocks are concerned, there isn't much impact."
22230039	Other fund managers were similarly sanguine.
22230040	"We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities," said Masato Murakami, chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co.
22230041	He said Friday's Wall Street decline was "well within the range of volatility" that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy.
22230042	Among other Asian and Pacific markets, Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses, with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5% and Singapore's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10%.
22230043	Major indexes declined more than 8% in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5% in Hong Kong.
22230044	Bangkok, Manila, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses.
22230045	Brokers and fund managers said the region's markets were reacting to Friday's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market.
22230046	"It's pure psychology," said William Au Yeung, an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert (HK) Ltd. in Hong Kong.
22230047	"Markets in this region aren't so geared to leveraged buy-outs, and their economies generally are in good shape, but there's no doubt that Asia is still following America's lead."
22230048	Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows.
22230049	Hong Kong is the region's next most open market, but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China.
22230050	"Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out, they tend to go where the liquidity is," said Elizabeth Hambrecht, a regional analyst with Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
22230051	She pointed out that even after Monday's 10% decline, the Straits Times index is up 24% this year, so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably.
22230052	Similarly, Kuala Lumpur's composite index yesterday ended 27.5% above its 1988 close.
22230053	In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70.
22230054	Trading was heavy at about one billion shares, compared with 473.9 million Friday.
22230055	But the session was orderly, in contrast to the market's four-day closure after the 1987 crash.
22230056	Richard Chenevix-Trench, a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd., said the market probably hasn't hit bottom yet but is close.
22230057	"If New York doesn't collapse, I see maybe another 5% on the downside, not counting the risk of bad news out of China," he said.
22230058	In Australia, Sydney's All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5, down 8.1%, its biggest drop since October 1987.
22230059	But volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million Friday.
22230060	Nestor Hinzack, an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett, Buckeridge & Young Ltd., described the market's performance as "sheep-like" as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price.
22230061	London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, ended at its intraday high of 2163.4, down 70.5, or 3.2%.
22230062	At its low, shortly before Wall Street opened, it was off more than 130 points.
22230063	The Financial Times 30-share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7.
22230064	Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday.
22230065	Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading.
22230066	The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points, or 12.8%, to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market's steepest fall ever.
22230067	Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale, pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20%.
22230068	Analysts cited memories of two years ago, when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline steeply for the next three months.
22230069	Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
22230070	To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
22230071	The percentage change is since year-end.
22231001	Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side, everything loose would end up in California.
22231002	We've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California's vitality, but maybe the state's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place.
22231003	What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state's attorney general?
22231004	If passed by the voters, the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, ban new offshore drilling, ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer, and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty.
22231005	The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment.
22231006	Interestingly, the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one.
22231007	Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed.
22231008	The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don't meet the initiative's standards.
22231009	Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market.
22231010	In other words, California is presuming to take control of the nation's farm policy.
22231011	As usual the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality.
22231012	Consider the greenhouse-effect provision.
22231013	The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%.
22231014	Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory, it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem.
22231015	But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative, what is going on?
22231016	The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit.
22231017	The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
22231018	He's running for governor.
22231019	Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6, 1990.
22231020	That's also the day of the gubernatorial election.
22231021	The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money.
22231022	And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits.
22231023	He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative (on which there are no limits) is gravy.
22231024	This initiative is being labeled The Big Green, but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback.
22231025	(The Republican candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, sponsoring his own crime initiative.)
22231026	While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional, it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through.
22231027	This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative.
22231028	If this new proposal ever does become law, the green lobby will benefit directly.
22231029	The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he doesn't like.
22231030	That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation; taxpayers would bear the cost.
22231031	Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.
22231032	Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves.
22231033	George Bush, for example, may decide that he doesn't want to be the President who lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California.
22231034	And some other segments of California's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs.
22231035	This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the futureeither as a state still tethered to economic and scientific reality, or as one being led to wherever its la-la activists want to take it.
22232001	First, there was a death watch.
22232002	Then exhilaration.
22232003	Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday's 190.58-point plunge, gaining 88.12 to 2657.38.
22232004	It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips, on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash.
22232005	While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday, it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders.
22232006	A troubling sign: Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers, 975 to 749, and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday's late Big Board plunge.
22232007	The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98.
22232008	Meanwhile, in a divergence in two of the market's most important indicators, the Dow industrials' sister average, the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Average, tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23 -- its second-worst decline next to the 164.78-point fall during the 1987 crash.
22232009	Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks, UAL and AMR, which each fell more than 20% when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon.
22232010	UAL, the takeover stock at the center of Friday's 190.58-point market plunge, fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares.
22232011	Overall, "this is a pleasant rally but it's very selective," said Arthur Cashin Jr., a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board.
22232012	"Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory.
22232013	It's just a strange feeling.
22232014	I don't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie."
22232015	The rally gave credence, at least for now, to the pre-trading declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday's market debacle was "an abnormal condition, and not a disaster."
22232016	But to traders, it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell.
22232017	The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30.
22232018	But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average, including Eastman Kodak and General Motors, couldn't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday's late-afternoon rout.
22232019	At 9:45, Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to 117.
22232020	The Dow dropped to a quick 27-point loss, and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble.
22232021	More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour, as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood.
22232022	Then, to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, hammering stocks into steeper losses.
22232023	There was heavy stock-index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets.
22232024	This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks.
22232025	The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized.
22232026	They didn't.
22232027	The Dow accelerated its slide, losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading.
22232028	With program traders seemingly in charge, buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall.
22232029	Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started to rebound, and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall.
22232030	And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who were responsible.
22232031	All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily.
22232032	The program traders were in there, too, of course.
22232033	But according to one trader, the programmers "didn't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was {also} a lot of bargain-hunting" by institutions.
22232034	Roland M. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment, which oversees $29 billion in investments, said the "first thing we did was to double our orders" yesterday morning.
22232035	"With the market down like this, we'll probably take another $50 million and put it in" the market.
22232036	Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders' eyes.
22232037	According to Big Board officials, Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday; it was one of the seven stocks that couldn't finish trading that day.
22232038	The stock opened late at 114 1/2, down 8 1/2.
22232039	But then it shot upward 7 1/2 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought, traders said.
22232040	However, Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said: "I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4% of the opening volume."
22232041	Around Wall Street, trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday, in contrast to Friday's gridlock.
22232042	At Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., head equity trader Dudley Eppel said: "I think the opening was constructive.
22232043	It was orderly.
22232044	We put some orders together.
22232045	There wasn't a lot of panic selling, either domestically or internationally. . . .
22232046	Not like Friday where they just took {the market} apart."
22232047	Still, the market hadn't yet crossed into positive territory, and traders were glum.
22232048	But in another dramatic burst, the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes, and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74.
22232049	On the Big Board floor and on trading desks, traders yelped their approval.
22232050	Grinned Griffith Peck, a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s OTC department: "I tell you, this market acts healthy."
22232051	Around him, scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off.
22232052	Among Big Board specialists, the cry was "Pull your offers" -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares.
22232053	"It was bedlam on the upside," said one Big Board specialist.
22232054	But not everybody was making money.
22232055	The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday.
22232056	Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses.
22232057	Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning.
22232058	"They were absolutely killed, slaughtered," said one Chicago-based options trader.
22232059	Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index, whose 20 stocks mimic the Dow industrials, didn't lead yesterday's big rally.
22232060	James Gallagher, a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau, said, "The difference between today and two years ago" -- "Terrible Tuesday," Oct. 20, 1987 -- "is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index, spend $2 million and get the program rally started.
22232061	This time {institutions} saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away.
22232062	Then when the market was at a technical level to buy, they came in with a vengeance."
22232063	However, according to one analyst, the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday.
22232064	"Futures were pulling the stock market higher," said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
22232065	Although the Big Board's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session, their performance yesterday was better than during Friday's late-afternoon chaos, according to traders and brokers who work with them.
22232066	Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge.
22232067	But yesterday, even with halts in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck, "we expected (the halts) and it wasn't too bad," said Donaldson's Mr. Eppel, who had been critical of the specialists' performance on Friday.
22232068	According to a Big Board official, while many stocks opened late, there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR, Merck and Valero Energy.
22232069	Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index.
22232070	No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days' gyrations.
22232071	Yet from the Dow industrials' high on Oct. 9 through Friday's plunge, relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate, utilities, precious metals and life insurance stocks.
22232072	And yesterday, the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues.
22232073	For example, Halliburton jumped 3 1/4 to 38, Schlumberger rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22.
22232074	Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles, airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday.
22232075	Philip Morris was the Big Board's most active issue, rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares.
22232076	Among other major issues, Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares.
22232077	Shares of International Business Machines, which reported earnings yesterday, finished at 103, up 1, after slipping below 100 during Friday's session for the first time in five years.
22232078	Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings.
22232079	Merrill Lynch added 1 3/4 to 28, PaineWebber rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3/8 to 14 1/4.
22232080	Federal National Mortgage Association, a recently hot stock, climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares.
22232081	At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday, the Big Board's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel.
22232082	Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies weren't responsible for triggering Friday's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months.
22232083	Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday's session, when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated, were program-related, he said.
22232084	Program trades make up 10% of the exchange's volume on an average day, but despite the increase Friday, it was "certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline," Mr. Phelan said.
22232085	Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday.
22232086	"Obviously, every time we get this kind of reaction, it's going to make everybody nervous, including me," he said.
22232087	He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that "all the participants behaved very, very responsibly today."
22232088	Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors.
22232089	"The institutions can't be criticized for their behavior," Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview.
22232090	"It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19.
22232091	They used their judgment.
22232092	They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning.
22232093	Instead, they bought on weakness and sold into the strength, which kept the market orderly.
22232094	Maybe they learned from experience."
22232095	Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday's plunge was admirable, because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and weren't reopened before the close.
22232096	"They did an excellent job," Mr. Phelan said of the specialists.
22232097	Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions.
22232098	James A. White and Sonja Steptoe contributed to this article.
22233001	West Germany's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter.
22233002	The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to "order" a permanent cancellation of the $1.5 billion flight.
22233003	A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a "frivolous" case.
22233004	Of course it was.
22233005	NASA should now sue for fines against all three politico-plaintiffs, foreign and domestic, for bringing this mischievous case.
22234001	A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii.
22234002	The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic, and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.
22234003	The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry, which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years.
22234004	By a 6-4 margin, House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights.
22234005	But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions.
22234006	As a practical matter, flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit, but the language would exempt longer routes beginning, for example, in Chicago or on the East Coast.
22234007	Within the Senate, the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative.
22234008	The measure is attached to the more than $26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg's jurisdiction, and the final compromise is laced with more than $205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports, including Denver.
22234009	From the outset, the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow.
22234010	But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states, such as North Carolina.
22234011	Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House, and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban.
22234012	Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest, the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane, but politically important, projects of members.
22234013	In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees, the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor.
22234014	"Anybody can vote as they want," said Rep. William Lehman (D., Fla.), head of the House conferees.
22234015	"But if you make a request, you should support the committee."
22234016	Within the Federal Aviation Administration, the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20% from last year, and total operations would rise to $3.84 billion -- a 12% boost.
22234017	The facilities account includes $40 million for Denver's ambitious new airport, and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver, United and Continental.
22234018	Leery of the costs -- and, critics say, competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver.
22234019	Texas Air Corp., which owns Continental, and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying.
22234020	The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50% of the gates.
22234021	But this was rejected in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase, expected to cost about $2 billion.
22234022	Though smaller in total dollars, the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports.
22234023	The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program, but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy.
22234024	Congress previously cut six airports this year.
22234025	The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $200 for each passenger in subsidies.
22234026	Among rail and highway accounts, the agreement provides $615 million for Amtrak, including $85 million for capital improvements.
22234027	And federal-formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen at $1.625 billion, or $20 million more than last fiscal year.
22235001	Enjoying several blockbuster movie hits including "Batman," Los Angeles-based Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $5.8 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss.
22235002	Sony Corp., which has offered to acquire the movie-production company, is seeking to free its top executives, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
22235003	Sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire Columbia for $3.4 billion, or $27 a share.
22235004	Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week; Sony and Guber-Peters have countersued, charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony's acquisition of the two companies.
22235005	Guber-Peters's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $6.9 million, or 62 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
22235006	The company said revenue rose 138%, to $10.9 million from $4.6 million, reflecting the success of its movies "Gorillas in the Mist" and "Rainman," as well as the box-office smash "Batman.
22236001	A group including Jon M. Huntsman of Salt Lake City, said it boosted its stake in Aristech Chemical Corp. to 8.36% of the the common shares outstanding.
22236002	As previously reported, Huntsman Holdings Corp., owned by Jon M. Huntsman and other members of his family, proposed that Banstar Corp., an affiliate of Huntsman Holdings, acquire Aristech in a friendly transaction for $25-a-share in cash, or $817.5 million.
22236003	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Huntsman group said it controls 2,720,675 Aristech common shares, including 306,000 shares bought from Aug. 21 to Oct. 13 for $20 to $20.875 per share.
22236004	Officials at Aristech, based in Pittsburgh, declined comment.
22237001	Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package.
22237002	Last month, the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures.
22237003	Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort "the first gift of democracy."
22237004	The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse.
22237005	It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page, 13-pound reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States.
22237006	Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles, they'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people.
22238001	Waterford Wedgwood PLC, a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china, reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts ($14.9 million) from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier.
22238002	The results for the half were worse than market expectations, which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts.
22238003	In a sharply weaker London market yesterday, Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence (79 cents).
22238004	The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts, compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year-earlier period.
22238005	There weren't any extraordinary items.
22238006	Sales for the total group rose 27% to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago.
22238007	Waterford has decided against paying an interim dividend.
22238008	Waterford said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company's long-term prospects.
22239001	The sudden "flight to quality" that triggered Friday's explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a "flight from quality" rout.
22239002	The setback, in which Treasury bond prices plummeted, reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking.
22239003	"It was a pretty wild day.
22239004	Our markets were closely tied to the stock market," said Joel Kazis, manager of trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
22239005	"Friday's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs," he said.
22239006	Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday.
22239007	That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds, which are safer than other types of securities.
22239008	But when stocks began to climb instead, prices of Treasury bonds declined.
22239009	Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios.
22239010	Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
22239011	The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2%.
22239012	The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%.
22239013	The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
22239014	Traders said yesterday's modest easing didn't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected.
22239015	In fact, some economists contend that the latest easing started last week.
22239016	Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing.
22239017	The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, ended about 1 3/4 points lower, or down about $17.50 for each $1,000 face amount.
22239018	The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities.
22239019	After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday, they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday.
22239020	The bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills, for example, was quoted late yesterday at 7.72%, compared with 7.16% Friday.
22239021	Investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell.
22239022	But prices of junk bonds, which were battered Friday in near standstill trading, rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session.
22239023	Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed.
22239024	Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying.
22239025	In particular, they said, firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels.
22239026	"I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds," said John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
22239027	U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan, which opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT.
22239028	The benchmark 30-year bond, for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600-point drop in the Tokyo stock market.
22239029	But as Japanese stocks rebounded, Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher.
22239030	Many U.S. trading operations, wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin, were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session.
22239031	"Most of the action was during the night session," said Michael Moore, trading manager at Continental Bank.
22239032	Jay Goldinger, who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif., said trading in Tokyo was "very active" but highly volatile.
22239033	"We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch, then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes," he said.
22239034	In Tokyo, trading is halted during lunchtime.
22239035	Tokyo's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading.
22239036	When the market opened here, bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength.
22239037	The bond market's focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it overshadowed today's slate of economic data, which includes the government's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production.
22239038	Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2%, according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
22239039	The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $9.1 billion from $7.58 billion in July.
22239040	A widening of that magnitude, said one New York trader, is "not a favorable number. . . .
22239041	It could do damage to us."
22239042	Meanwhile, agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $2.3 billion offering of one-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year maturities.
22239043	Tomorrow, the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue, which is expected to total between $4 billion and $6 billion and carry a maturity greater than 20 years.
22239044	Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts.
22239045	And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to price a $3 billion offering, its first public debt borrowing in 15 years.
22239046	"There's lots of supply," the New York trader said.
22239047	"We have a couple or three tough weeks coming."
22239048	Treasury Securities
22239049	Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading.
22239050	The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19/32, compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday.
22239051	The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97% from 7.82%.
22239052	The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97%, compared with 101 9/32 to yield 7.84%.
22239053	Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government's weekly Treasury bill auction.
22239054	The average discount rate on new three-month Treasury bills was 7.37%, the lowest since the average of 7.36% at the auction on Oct. 17, 1988.
22239055	The average discount rate was 7.42% on new six-month bills, the lowest since the average of 7.35% at the auction on July 31, 1989.
22239056	Here are auction details:
22239057	Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
22239058	Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
22239059	The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.
22239060	Both issues are dated Oct. 19.
22239061	The 13-week bills mature Jan. 18, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature April 19, 1990.
22239062	Corporate Issues
22239063	Investment-grade corporate bonds ended one to 1 1/2 point lower.
22239064	There were no new issues.
22239065	Foreign Bonds
22239066	Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies.
22239067	Among benchmark issues: -- Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15, up 1.17 point.
22239068	The yield was 5.245%.
22239069	-- West Germany's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended at 98.30, up 0.91 point to yield 6.99%.
22239070	-- Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/8 higher at 111 19/32 to yield 10.12%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 rose 21/32 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.74%.
22239071	Mortgage-Backed Securities
22239072	Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower.
22239073	Dealers said morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities, but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon.
22239074	Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4/32, down 30/32 from Friday; 9 1/2% securities were down 27/32 at 100 5/32; and 10% securities were at 102 2/32, off 24/32.
22239075	Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 1/4, down 3/4.
22239076	On Friday, mortgage issues gained as much as 1 5/32.
22239077	Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.39% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42.
22239078	Traders said there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved to gather collateral for new deals.
22239079	Offsetting the Remic-related purchases were continued heavy sales by mortgage originators, which are producing increased amounts of fixed-rate mortgage-backed issues with lower rates.
22239080	There was no new-issue activity in the derivative market.
22239081	Municipals
22239082	Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1/4 to 3/4 point lower in late dealings.
22239083	The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally.
22239084	Trading was hectic during the morning, with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness.
22239085	Tax-exempts started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion, but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash wasn't at hand.
22239086	Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session.
22239087	Traders said retail investors seemed to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market.
22239088	New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid, yielding 7.32%, up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday.
22239089	Florida Board of Education's 7 1/4% issue of 2023 was 5/8 point weaker at 99 1/2 bid.
22239090	The 7 1/8% issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York, due 2019, was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid.
22239091	And Fairfax County, Va., Water Authority's 7 1/4% issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid.
22239092	Serial bond yields were up about 0.05 percentage point.
22240001	BMA Corp., Kansas City, Mo., said it's weighing "strategic alternatives," for its Business Men's Assurance Co. unit, and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation.
22240002	A BMA spokesman said "runaway medical costs" have made health insurance "a significant challenge," and margins also have been pinched by changes in the mix of life-insurance products consumers now demand.
22240003	The Business Men's Assurance unit represented about $288 million of the company's $488 million in 1988 revenue, and the unit's operating income was about $10 million, said the spokesman.
22240004	BMA's investment banker, Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., has been authorized to contact possible buyers for the unit.
22241001	Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said it raised its stake in ADT Ltd. of Bermuda to 29.4% from 28%.
22241002	A spokesman for Laidlaw declined to disclose the price the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid for the additional shares, which he said were acquired "over the last couple of weeks."
22241003	The spokesman said Laidlaw wouldn't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% "without a great deal of thought" because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than 30% to extend an offer to the rest of the company's shareholders.
22241004	ADT, a security services and auctions company, trades on London's Stock Exchange.
22241005	Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd., a Montreal transportation, resources and industrial holding concern.
22242001	Nintendo Co., a Japanese maker of video games, electronic information systems and playing cards, posted a 23% unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen ($429 million) from 50 billion yen ($349.9 million) for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31.
22242002	Sales surged 40% to 250.17 billion yen from 178.61 billion.
22242003	Net income rose 11% to 29.62 billion yen from 26.68 billion.
22242004	Pershare net fell to 423.3 yen from 457.7 yen because of expenses and capital adjustments.
22242005	Without detailing specific product breakdowns, Nintendo credited its bullish upsurge in sales -- including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems -- to surging "leisure-oriented" sales in foreign markets.
22242006	Export sales for leisure items alone, for instance, totaled 184.74 billion yen in the 12 months, up from 106.06 billion in the previous fiscal year.
22242007	Domestic leisure sales, however, were lower.
22243001	Hertz Corp. of Park Ridge, N.J., said it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell its Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. unit.
22243002	"There is no pressing need to sell the unit, but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business, renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad," said William Slider, Hertz's executive vice president.
22243003	"We are only going to sell at the right price."
22243004	Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $90 million on revenue of $150 million in 1988.
22243005	The closely held Hertz Corp. had annual revenue of close to $2 billion in 1988, of which $1.7 billion was contributed by its Hertz Rent A Car operations world-wide.
22243006	Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S., France, Spain and the U.K.
22243007	It supplies commercial and industrial equipment including earth-moving, aerial, compaction and electrical equipment, compressors, cranes, forklifts and trucks.
22244001	Interspec Inc. reported a net loss of $2.4 million for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31.
22244002	It said the loss resulted from startup and introduction costs related to a new medical ultrasound equipment system.
22244003	In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported net income of $955,000, or 15 cents a share.
22244004	The manufacturer of ultrasound diagnostic systems, based in Ambler, Pa., reported a nine-month net loss of $2.43 million compared with net income of $2.71 million, or 44 cents a share, for the nine-month period a year earlier.
22244005	In over-the-counter trading, Interspec fell 37.5 cents to $4.25.
22245001	Allegheny Ludlum Corp. expects to report third-quarter net of about $34 million, or $1.50 a share, down from $38.4 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, Richard P. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer, told institutional investors in New York.
22245002	Sales for the Pittsburgh-based producer of specialty steels and other materials fell to about $265 million in the third quarter from $320.5 million a year earlier, he said.
22245003	He said the third-quarter estimate indicates profit for the nine months of $4.65 a share, "almost equal to the full-year 1988 earnings" of $108.6 million, or $4.81 a share.
22245004	In the first nine months of 1988, net was $85 million, or $3.76 a share.
22245005	Mr. Simmons said the third-quarter results reflect continued improvements in productivity and operating margins.
22245006	He said capital spending next year will rise to about $45 million from about $35 million this year.
22246001	U.S. Banknote Co. said it again extended the expiration date of its $7-a-share tender offer for International Banknote Co. to Nov. 15.
22246002	U.S. Banknote said it is in negotiations to sell "certain facilities," which it didn't name, to a third party, and it needs the extension to try to reach a definitive agreement on the sale.
22246003	U.S. Banknote said it believes the sale, if completed, apparently would satisfy antitrust issues raised by the U.S. Justice Department about U.S. Banknote's offer to buy International Banknote.
22246004	Both of the New York-based companies print stock certificates and currency.
22246005	U.S. Banknote said "there can be no assurance" a sale agreement would be concluded.
22246006	It also said the tender offer would probably have to be extended further to complete financing arrangements.
22246007	U.S. Banknote said Citibank extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to Nov. 15.
22246008	The offer, made June 1, has been extended several times.
22246009	Closely held U.S. Banknote offered the $7 a share, or $126 million, for as many as 14.9 million shares, or 78.6%, of International Banknote's shares outstanding.
22246010	U.S. Banknote said that as of Oct. 13, 16.1 million shares, or about 84.3% of the fully diluted shares outstanding, had been tendered.
22247001	Gitano Group Inc. said it agreed to buy 50% of Regatta Sport Ltd., a closely held apparel maker, with the assumption of $3 million of contingent debt.
22247002	Under the terms of the contract, New York-based Gitano has the option to acquire the remaining 50% of Regatta, a maker of men's and women's clothes sold primarily in department stores, under certain conditions.
22247003	That 50% is now held by Clifford Parker, Regatta's president and chief executive officer, who will continue to manage Regatta's operations under Gitano.
22247004	In 1989, Regatta will have sales "in excess of $10 million" and will show a profit, Mr. Parker said.
22247005	Gitano, which makes budget-priced apparel sold mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal-Mart, said the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy to expand into department stores.
22247006	This fall, Gitano began manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed at department stores under the Gloria Vanderbilt trademark, which Gitano recently acquired.
22248001	Enron Corp., Houston, said the sale of preference units of its newly formed Enron NGL Partners L.P. master limited partnership subsidiary will result in an undetermined gain in the fourth quarter.
22248002	In the year-ago quarter, the natural gas concern had net income of $25.2 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of about $1.46 billion.
22248003	Those results included a $2.7 million charge related to the retirement of debt.
22248004	In a related move, Enron said it increased the number of the partnership's units it will offer to 6,930,000 from 5,500,000.
22248005	The old and revised numbers both include over-allotment provisions.
22248006	Enron said each unit will be priced in the $19-to-$21 range and will represent about 80% of the partnership equity.
22248007	Net proceeds from the offering are expected to be close to $200 million.
22248008	Goldman, Sachs & Co., and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are lead underwriters.
22249001	Arthur M. Goldberg said he extended his unsolicited tender offer of $32 a share tender offer, or $154.3 million, for Di Giorgio Corp. to Nov. 1.
22249002	DIG Acquisition Corp., the New Jersey investor's acquisition vehicle, said that as of the close of business yesterday, 560,839 shares had been tendered.
22249003	Including the stake DIG already held, DIG holds a total of about 25% of Di Giorgio's shares on a fully diluted basis.
22249004	The offer, which also includes common and preferred stock purchase rights, was to expire last night at midnight.
22249005	The new expiration date is the date on which DIG's financing commitments, which total about $240 million, are to expire.
22249006	DIG is a unit of DIG Holding Corp., a unit of Rose Partners L.P.
22249007	Mr. Goldberg is the sole general partner in Rose Partners.
22249008	In August, Di Giorgio, a San Francisco food products and building materials marketing and distribution company, rejected Mr. Goldberg's offer as inadequate.
22249009	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Di Giorgio closed at $31.50 a share, down $1.75.
22250001	What doesn't belong here?
22250002	A. manual typewriters, B. black-and-white snapshots, C. radio adventure shows.
22250003	If you guessed black-and-white snapshots, you're right.
22250004	After years of fading into the background, two-tone photography is coming back.
22250005	Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans, shoes and liquor.
22250006	Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders.
22250007	And black-and-white photography classes are crowded with students.
22250008	What's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion, home furnishings and cinematography.
22250009	On Seventh Avenue, designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white.
22250010	And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes, spurred, in part, by the backlash against colorization of old films.
22250011	"The pendulum is swinging back to black and white," says Richard DeMoulin, the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co.'s professional photography division.
22250012	Until two years ago, sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s.
22250013	But last year, buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications, sales increased 5%, and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year.
22250014	Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market, reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones.
22250015	At Kodak, which largely ignored the market for years, black-and-white film sales now account for nearly 15% of the company's $3 billion in film and paper sales annually, up from 10% three years ago.
22250016	The Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant recently began marketing T-Max 3200, one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films.
22250017	Aimed at commercial photographers, the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality, says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter.
22250018	Also trying to snare a portion of the $2 billion-a-year industry is Agfa Corp., a unit of Bayer AG.
22250019	Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak's papers.
22250020	Slated for market by the end of the year, the paper "could have been introduced a long time ago but the market wasn't there then," says an Agfa spokesman.
22250021	The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co.'s Ilford division, known in the industry for its premium products.
22250022	Sales of Ilford's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market, although the company won't say by exactly how much.
22250023	"We hope the trend lasts," says Laurie DiCara, Ilford's marketing communications director.
22250024	Why all the interest?
22250025	For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color, black and white seems eye-catching and exotic.
22250026	"It has an archival, almost nostalgic quality to it," says Owen B. Butler, the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology.
22250027	"You can shift out of reality with black and white," he adds.
22250028	Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives, who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising.
22250029	Processing of black-and-white commercial film jumped 24% last year to 18.7 million rolls.
22250030	Consider Gap Inc., whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars, artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer's jeans and T-shirts.
22250031	Richard Crisman, the account manager for the campaign, says Gap didn't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors.
22250032	"We wanted to highlight the individual, not the environment," he says, "and black and white allows you to do that better than color."
22250033	The campaign won a Cleo award as this year's best ad by a specialty retailer.
22250034	Even food products and automobiles, which have long depended on color, are making the switch.
22250035	Companies "feel black and white will convey a stronger statement," says Marc L. Hauser, a Chicago photographer who is working on a black-and-white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp.'s Lean Cuisine.
22250036	Other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc.
22250037	Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend.
22250038	Using black and white, "we can make housewives look like stars," says John Perrin.
22250039	His On-Broadway Photography studio in Portland, Ore., doubled its business last year and, he says, is booked solid for the next five.
22250040	One customer, Dayna Brunsdon, says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because "it's more dramatic.
22250041	I show it to my friends, and they all say 'wow.'
22250042	It isn't ordinary like color."
22250043	Still, most consumers aren't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots.
22250044	One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore.
22250045	Typically, it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned.
22250046	Black-and-white film costs consumers a little less than color film, and processing costs the same.
22250047	But for photofinishers, developing costs for black-and-white film are higher.
22250048	Some companies are starting to tackle that problem.
22250049	Ilford, for example, recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs.
22250050	Intent on wooing customers, the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes.
22250051	Similarly, Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges, offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes.
22250052	And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently.
22250053	Other companies are introducing related products.
22250054	Charles Beseler Co., a leading maker of photographic enlargers, introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs.
22250055	The kit, which has a suggested retail price of $250 and has already become a bestseller, was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children's photography equipment.
22250056	"It seems computers as hobbies have waned," says Ian Brightman, Beseler's chairman and chief executive officer.
22250057	But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad.
22250058	They cite the emergence of still electronic photography, more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints.
22250059	"Black and white hasn't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color," says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute.
22250060	"The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago.
22250061	You can't say the same with black and white."
22250062	But when Popular Photography, a leading magazine for photographers, selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography's 150th anniversary, all were black and white.
22250063	"It's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally," says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America.
22250064	"That's the appeal.
22251001	McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said improvements in advertising and subscription revenue led to a 21% gain in third-quarter profit to $8.8 million, or 31 cents a share, from $7.2 million, or 25 cents a share.
22251002	Sales rose more than 7% to $94.9 million from $88.3 million.
22251003	The Sacramento, Calif., company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income.
22251004	For the nine months, the newspaper chain had almost a 23% increase in profit to $23.6 million, or 83 cents a share, from $19.2 million, or 68 cents a share.
22251005	Sales grew almost 7% to $279.1 million from $261.3 million.
22251006	McClatchy publishes the Sacramento (Calif.) Bee and Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune, and other papers in Western states.
22251007	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company closed at $25.25 a share, down 25 cents.
22252001	Agip S.p.A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine, the state oil companies of Italy and France, respectively, submitted an offer to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A.
22252002	The price wasn't disclosed.
22252003	A spokesman for Gatoil said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer, submitted last Friday, along with two other offers, also submitted last week.
22252004	Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies.
22252005	The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks.
22252006	Gatoil Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day, along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets.
22253001	While Friday's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy's prospects, a little-known indicator that has faithfully foreshadowed the economy's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity.
22253002	The barometer, developed by analysts at Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research here, reached a record high of 223.0 in August, the latest month available, and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then.
22253003	The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March.
22253004	The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator, which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100.
22253005	In contrast, the Commerce Department's widely followed index of leading indicators, while up in August, has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year.
22253006	Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year's end.
22253007	But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index "makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely," says Geoffrey H. Moore, the director of the Columbia facility.
22253008	A leading authority on the business cycle, Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group, the panel of private economists that decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end.
22253009	The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy's general course seems likely.
22253010	"No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks," Mr. Moore reports.
22253011	Based largely on the recent strength in their index, called the long leading indicator, the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well.
22253012	They expect a 2.6% rise in 1990 in the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation.
22253013	Underlying this optimism is the index's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries, as the case may be, by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
22253014	Over the full post-World War II era, the Columbia index, on the average, has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries.
22253015	The comparable lead times for the Commerce index, whose components include the stock market, are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries.
22253016	The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved, had it existed, in 1929, before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression.
22253017	The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash.
22253018	"It was an entirely different pattern from what we're seeing now," Mr. Moore says.
22253019	A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index, which is not a part of the Commerce index.
22253020	In August, the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987.
22253021	It also rose last Friday, while the stock market sagged.
22253022	Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries, the M2 version of the money supply, adjusted for inflation, and the volume of new home-building permits.
22253023	Notably absent from the Columbia index is the stock market, which Mr. Moore says "is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy's long-range prospects, though it still is useful for anticipating some short-run twists and turns."
22253024	As recently as 1975, the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index.
22253025	It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100, compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components.
22253026	The stock market has lost some precursory power, analysts at the Columbia center claim, because of the growing impact of international developments.
22253027	"Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy," Mr. Moore says, citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets, the foreign-trade balance and inflows of foreign capital.
22253028	He also feels that the rise of such computer-based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market's relevancy to the economic outlook.
22254001	BSN S.A., a leading French food group, said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b.H., a West German pasta maker.
22254002	The value of the acquisition wasn't disclosed.
22254003	The move is in line with BSN's strategy of gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth.
22254004	BSN will initially acquire a 15% interest in Birkel, a closely held concern.
22254005	The French group has an agreement giving it the right to buy all the shares outstanding, and this could be completed within a few months, a BSN spokeswoman said.
22254006	The takeover was submitted for approval by the West German cartel office, BSN said.
22254007	Birkel is West Germany's second-biggest producer of pasta, with sales of 250 million marks ($133.4 million) in 1988.
22254008	It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany, and is that nation's leading producer of pasta sauces.
22254009	The acquisition strengthens BSN's position in the European pasta market.
22254010	The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy, whose sales are chiefly in the Italian market.
22255001	Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company, to C from Ca, saying it believes bondholders will recover only "negligible principal."
22255002	The agency said it confirmed American Continental's preferred stock rating at C.
22255003	American Continental's thrift unit, Los Angeles-based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
22255004	CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK (Miami) --
22255005	Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B-3.
22255006	The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa.
22255007	The rating agency said about $85 million in securities was affected.
22255008	The downgrades were prompted, Moody's said, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust's preferred stock.
22255009	Moody's also said it believed the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could, if completed, endanger the thrift's funding and market position.

22258001	Intel Corp. said it reached an agreement with Alliant Computer Systems Corp. to develop software standards for Intel's i860 microprocessor.
22258002	The i860, introduced earlier this year, is Intel's entry in the crowded market for reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, computers.
22258003	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that forms the heart of IBM-compatible personal computers.
22258004	Under the agreement, Intel will invest $3 million to acquire a 4% stake in Alliant, a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers.
22258005	Alliant, based in Littleton, Mass., will license its parallel-computing technologies to Intel, providing users a way to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously.
22258006	Alliant said it plans to use the microprocessor in future products.
22258007	It declined to discuss its plans for upgrading its current product line.
22259001	Omnicare Inc., which intends to expand its position in the medical and dental markets, said it acquired a cotton and gauze products division from closely held Sterile Products Corp. for $8.2 million.
22259002	Omnicare said it expects the division to add "substantial sales volume and to make a positive contribution to our earnings in 1990 and beyond."
22259003	In 1988 the Cincinnati company earned $3.1 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $148.5 million.
22259004	Omnicare said the division operates under the trade name ACCO and supplies the medical and dental markets.
22259005	The business, based in St. Louis, had sales of more than $14 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, Omnicare said.
22260001	Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern, said SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands has built up a 6.7% stake in the company.
22260002	James Alexander, a Burmah spokesman, said SHV had previously owned "a little under 5%" of Burmah for about two years.
22260003	The Dutch company hadn't notified Burmah of its reason for increasing the stake, he said.
22260004	SHV, which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC, has been pegged by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks.
22260005	SHV also owns 40% of Calor.
22260006	Burmah, which owns the Castrol brand of lubricant oils, reported a 17% rise in net income to #43.5 million ($68.3 million) in the first half.
22261001	J.P. Industries Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its Builders' Hardware Group to closely held Nalcor Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif.
22261002	Terms weren't disclosed, but a J.P. Industries spokesman said the amount J.P. Industries will get for the group is "a little better than expected by the marketplace, and the marketplace had been expecting $25 million to $30 million."
22261003	The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc.
22261004	J.P. Industries, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the sale completes a previously announced program to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations.
22261005	The company's remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications.
22262001	Citing a $3.1 million provision for doubtful accounts, Dallas-based National Heritage Inc. posted a loss for its fourth quarter ended June 30.
22262002	A unit of troubled Southmark Corp., the operator of nursing homes and retirement centers said it sustained a net loss of $1.6 million, or nine cents a share, compared with net income of $1.3 million, or eight cents a share, a year earlier.
22262003	Operating revenue rose 13% to $22.2 million from $19.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.
22262004	The company said the $3.1 million reserve was created to reflect doubt about the collectability of receivables owed to National Heritage by some of the real estate partnerships it manages.
22262005	The company also said expenses incurred by the previous board and management in the recent contest for control were recognized primarily in the first quarter ended Sept. 30.
22262006	National Heritage stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $1.375 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
22263001	United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC, a British food producer, announced the creation of a European group to bring together its trading interests in the region.
22263003	United Biscuits said the combined group, which will include businesses such as McVities biscuits and Terry's confectionery, will have annual sales of more than #1.5 billion ($2.35 billion) and trading profit of more than #160 million ($251 million).
22263004	"The new structure will enable United Biscuits to focus clearly upon opportunities for planned growth during the 1990s," said Bob Clarke, deputy chairman and group chief executive.
22263005	Last month, United Biscuits agreed to sell its entire restaurant operations to Grand Metropolitan PLC for #180 million.
22264001	An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia.
22264002	This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it's going to hold an election.
22264003	The most likely winner will be the Marxist-dominated SWAPO rebels.
22264004	The U.S. journalist's "crime" was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election's fairness, Bryan O'Linn, was openly sympathetic to SWAPO.
22264005	Shortly after that, Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated.
22264006	Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation, issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year, which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to "insult, disparate or belittle" the election commission.
22264007	The Stanley affair doesn't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts running the government.
22264008	To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa.
22264009	SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the "sole, authentic representative" of Namibia's people in
22264010	Last year, the U.S. brokered a peace settlement to remove Cuba's "Afrika Korps" from Angola and hold "free and fair" elections that would end South Africa's control of Namibia.
22264011	The elections are set for Nov. 7.
22264012	In July, Mr. Stanley, editor of American Press International, a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service, visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign.
22264013	He interviewed Mr. O'Linn, head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court.
22264014	After Mr. Stanley's article was published in two Namibian newspapers, Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors, publisher and lawyer.
22264015	Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month.
22264016	Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley's detention.
22264017	Mr. Stanley's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia's elections.
22264018	Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters.
22264019	The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results.
22264020	It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia.
22264021	State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United Nation's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides.
22265001	Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday.
22265002	Yesterday, the stock market's influence at first created nervousness.
22265003	Later, however, it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors.
22265004	Gold, the traditional haven in times of financial crisis, continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar, rising early in the day as the currency fell, and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered.
22265005	Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy.
22265006	Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved.
22265007	Crude oil declined early, but as the stock market retained early gains, it, too, became stronger, ending with a small net loss.
22265008	Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines.
22265009	In Chicago, grain and soybean prices rose slightly.
22265010	Livestock and meat prices, however, dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork.
22265011	In commodity markets yesterday: PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently, first falling and then later rising.
22265012	Silver performed quietly.
22265013	The spot October gold price rose $4 to $367.30 an ounce.
22265014	The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $3.90 an ounce at $371.20, after trading as high as $374.
22265015	December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.163.
22265016	Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal, easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy, but recovering later, as the stock market strengthened.
22265017	Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday.
22265018	For one thing, last Friday, precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive, so it couldn't react to it.
22265019	Back on Friday, Oct. 16, l987, the stock market declined during the day, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell.
22265020	The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $8.70 to as high as $471.60, and the more deferred positions, due to mature as late as March 1989, rose as much as $9.60.
22265021	On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, rising to as high as $491.50 for a gain of almost $20 on top of the Friday advances, before giving up almost $10 of that at the close.
22265022	Yesterday's October gain of $4 was miniscule compared with that.
22265023	One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market.
22265024	"What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened," said Mr. Cardillo.
22265025	There's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further, he said.
22265026	He expects a drop in interest rates, which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising.
22265027	Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released today.
22265028	This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold, he said.
22265029	ENERGY:
22265030	Worried that Friday's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy, petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices.
22265031	The U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $20.59 a barrel for November delivery, down 30 cents.
22265032	Some analysts said crude was due for a correction anyhow, following several days of significant gains.
22265033	But most market observers agreed that Friday's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday.
22265034	Until yesterday, futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong.
22265035	The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand.
22265036	So any bearish indicator, such as Friday's precipitous drop in the stock market, sends shivers through the oil markets as well.
22265037	Indeed, after reacting early in the trading day to Friday's plummet, futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market's partial recovery yesterday.
22265038	COPPER:
22265039	Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved.
22265040	The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $1.2745.
22265041	Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use.
22265042	But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst.
22265043	Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank.
22265044	Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company.
22265045	Now, the analyst said, only minor points remain to be cleaned up.
22265046	"For all intents and purposes, an agreement appears to have been achieved," he said.
22265047	Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to 10,004 tons.
22265048	London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons, to 89,300 tons.
22265049	The LME stocks decline was about as expected, but the Comex gain wasn't.
22265050	However, this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said.
22265051	At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $1.2965, but it wasn't able to sustain the gain.
22265052	"It was simply overbought," he said, and selling by funds that are computer guided helped depress prices.
22265053	COTTON:
22265054	Futures prices eased, more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market.
22265055	The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound, at 74.48 cents.
22265056	Technical considerations following the hurricane, which was a factor in the market Friday, caused prices to decline yesterday, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York.
22265057	Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana, which is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton-growing area.
22265058	However, after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane, prices began to slip late Friday, Mr. Simon said.
22265059	That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure, he said.
22265060	Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend, Mr. Simon said.
22265061	That hasn't yet captured traders' attention, he added.
22265062	SUGAR:
22265063	Futures prices declined.
22265064	The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents.
22265065	At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered, but the price then fell back.
22265066	A price-depressing factor, one analyst said, was that India, which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market, didn't make any purchases.
22265067	India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more, the analyst said.
22265068	Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market.
22265069	"India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices," said Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York.
22265070	At any rate, she added, "India needs the sugar, so it will be in sooner or later to buy it."
22265071	FARM PRODUCTS:
22265072	The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket, which would hurt demand for beef and pork.
22265073	The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound.
22265074	The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering.
22265075	Earlier in the session, the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows.
22265076	A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts, apparently to take advantage of the price dip.
22266001	Knight-Ridder Inc. said it would report increased earnings per share for the third quarter, contrary to reported analysts' comments that the publishing company's earnings would be down.
22266002	A company spokesman said he believed the confusion was caused when James Batten, Knight-Ridder's chairman and chief executive, told New York analysts two weeks ago that Knight-Ridder's earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would "be behind a little bit" from like period of
22266003	The Knight-Ridder spokesman said the third-quarter earnings that the company plans to report Oct. 24 are expected to be up.
22266004	The spokesman said he was "comfortable" with revised analysts' projections that the company would report earnings of between 62 cents and 64 cents a share, compared with the 53 cents a share it reported for the 1988 third quarter.
22266005	Knight-Ridder said it agreed with estimates that net income for all of 1989 would be around $2.86 a share, compared with $2.59 a share a year earlier.
22266006	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Knight-Ridder closed at $51.75, down 37.5 cents.
22267001	DD Acquisition Corp. said it extended its $45-a-share offer for Dunkin' Donuts Inc. to Nov. 1 from yesterday.
22267002	The offer has an indicated value of $268 million.
22267003	DD Acquisition is a partnership of Unicorp Canada Corp.'s Kingsbridge Capital Group unit and Cara Operations Ltd.
22267004	As previously reported, under the terms of a confidentiality agreement with Dunkin' Donuts, the partners agreed to keep their offer open until Nov. 1, and not to acquire any additional shares except through a tender offer expiring on that date.
22267005	DD Acquisition said that it already owns 15% of the common shares of the doughnut shop chain and that as of the close of business Friday an additional 11% had been tendered to its offer.
22267006	Dunkin' Donuts is based in Randolph, Mass.
22267007	Cara Operations, a food services concern, and Unicorp, a holding company with interests in oil and natural gas and financial services, are based in Toronto.
22268001	Golden West Financial Corp., riding above the turbulence that has troubled most of the thrift industry, posted a 16% increase of third-quarter earnings to $41.8 millon, or 66 cents a share.
22268002	The company earned $36 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
22268003	Herbert M. Sandler, chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland, Calif., savings-and-loan holding company, credited the high number of loans added to the company's portfolio over the last 12 months for broadening its earning asset base and improving profit performance.
22268004	However, the executive noted that slackening demand for new mortgages depressed new loan originations to $1 billion, 30% below the same period last year.
22268005	In savings activity, Mr. Sandler said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989, and topped $11 billion at quarter's end for the first time in the company's history.
22268006	Deposit growth amounted to $393 million, more than double the year-ago figure.
22269001	Whirlpool Corp., Benton Harbor, Mich., said it has developed a process to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that previously entered the atmosphere during in-home repair of refrigerators and freezers.
22269002	The maker of home appliances said the process, which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center, is already in use at a number of its service centers, and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring.
22269003	Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere.
22269004	CFCs are widely used as solvents, coolants and fire suppressants.
22269005	But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use, or at least emission, of the substance.
22269006	Whirpool said, "We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture.
22270001	Maxus Energy Corp., Dallas, said it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia.
22270002	Maxus said it didn't run a production test on the three discovery wells it drilled in the field, which is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field, because the wells are similar to others drilled at its Intan and Widuri fields.
22270003	However, Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil.
22270004	The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels.
22270005	Maxus, an independent oil and gas concern, is the operator and owns a 56% interest in the new field, called Northeast Intan.
22270006	Other interests are owned by BP Petroleum Development (SES) Ltd., C. Itoh Energy Co. Ltd., Deminex Sumatra OEL G.m.b.H., Hispanoil (Sumatra) Production Ltd., Hudbay Oil (Indonesia) Ltd., Inpex Sumatra Co. Ltd., Lasmo Sumatra Ltd., Sunda Shell, TCR Sumat A.G. and Warrior Oil Co.
22270007	The production-sharing contract area is held with Pertamina, the Indonesian state oil company.
22271001	Environmental Systems Co. said it is restating its results to reduce its reported net income for the first nine months of its fiscal year after discovering it took tax credits that already had been taken last year.
22271002	The Little Rock, Ark., hazardous-waste services company said the restatement will reduce its net for the nine months ended July 31 to $2.5 million, or 17 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 26 cents a share.
22271003	Net for the third quarter, restated, is $1.6 million, or 10 cents a share.
22271004	The company previously reported net of $2.3 million, or 15 cents a share.
22271005	The company said that for financial reporting purposes last year it took tax credits that will be recognized for tax purposes this year.
22271006	But because of confusion, it took those credits again in reporting its results through the first nine months.
22271007	Jack W. Forrest, Environmental Systems president and chief executive officer, said the change increases the company's effective tax rate to about 35% from 20%.
22272002	In American Stock Exchange composite trading, ISI closed up $3.125 at $18.625.
22272003	In Montreal Exchange trading, Memotec closed unchanged at 10.625 Canadian dollars (US$9.05).
22272004	Memotec said under the agreement, ISI, a Braintree, Mass., provider of computer software and services to the insurance industry, will merge with a U.S. unit of Memotec created for that purpose.
22272005	Memotec is a Montreal-based maker of telecommunications products and provider of telecommunications and computer services.
22272006	Memotec said the agreement calls for it to make a $20-a-share cash tender offer for all shares outstanding of ISI.
22272007	But it said Charles Johnston, ISI chairman and president, agreed to sell his 60% stake in ISI to Memotec upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash, Memotec stock and debentures.
22272008	Memotec said the tender offer is conditioned on, among other things, holders tendering at least 15% of the shares outstanding, other than the shares held by Mr. Johnston.
22272009	ISI said its board has instructed management to accept inquiries from any others interested in making a bid.
22272010	ISI said it can withdraw from the merger agreement with Memotec if a better bid surfaces.
22273001	CMS Energy Corp., Jackson, Mich., said it has resumed the purchase of its common stock under a program approved by its directors in 1987.
22273002	At the time of the original announcement, CMS said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its shares.
22273003	A spokesman said 2.6 million shares have been purchased since then.
22273004	The company said it will buy additional shares "from time to time in the open market or in private transactions at prevailing market prices."
22273005	In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CMS Energy closed at $34.375 a share, down 62.5 cents, from the closing price of $37.375 a share on Thursday, before Friday's plunge.
22273006	The utility company currently has about 82.1 million shares outstanding.
22273007	Morgan Stanley & Co. will act as the exclusive broker for the repurchase.
22274001	Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp., said it agreed to purchase the Electro-Optics Technology division of Perkin-Elmer Corp.
22274002	Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.
22274003	But for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988, the most recent period for which results were broken out, the Perkin-Elmer unit accounted for more than half the $145 million in sales recorded by the company's government systems sector.
22274004	Perkin-Elmer, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., said the sale of the Danbury, Conn., unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced in April.
22274005	In addition to making electro-optical systems, the unit also makes laser warning receivers.
22274006	These are used aboard military helicopters to warn pilots that a laser weapon has been focused on them.
22274007	Hughes of Los Angeles said the PerkinElmer unit's work complements efforts by its Electro-Optical and Data Systems group, which makes infrared sensors, military lasers and night vision equipment.
22274008	Hughes said it expects the sale to close by year end.
22275001	The Communications Workers of America ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with Bell Atlantic Corp.
22275002	CWA's New Jersey Commercial local, which represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees, rejected the tentative agreement.
22275003	Both the union and the regional telephone company said they were working together to resolve differences.
22275004	The new three-year contracts, which replace ones that expired Aug. 5, cover 41,000 Bell Atlantic employees.
22275005	The ratification follows a 23-day strike against the Philadelphia-based company.
22275006	Meanwhile, CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members remain on strike against Nynex Corp., the New York-based regional phone company.
22275007	The unions and the company last week agreed to mediation.
22275008	The CWA represents 40,000 Nynex workers and the IBEW represents 20,000 workers.
22276001	For the moment, at least, euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street.
22276002	The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38, panic didn't sweep the world's markets, and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction, not a calamity.
22276003	Many went bargain-hunting.
22276004	Among those sighing with relief was John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Brothers, who took to the firm's trading floor to monitor yesterday's events.
22276005	As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m., he smiled broadly, brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn, his top stock trader, on the back.
22276006	At first, it seemed as if history might repeat itself.
22276007	As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board, stocks of many of the nation's biggest companies couldn't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers.
22276008	By 10:10, the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points, and the stock of UAL Corp., whose troubles had kicked off Friday's plunge, still hadn't opened.
22276009	But then, as quickly as the Dow had fallen, it began to turn around.
22276010	It ended with a gain of 88.12 points.
22276011	By the market's close, volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million, the fourth highest on record.
22276012	The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain, in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987.
22276013	But the rally was largely confined to the blue-chip stocks, which had been hard hit during Friday's selling frenzy.
22276014	Overall, more Big Board stocks lost money than gained.
22276015	And many arbitragers, already reeling from Friday's collapse of the UAL deal, were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, collapsed.
22276016	Indeed, the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points, its second-worst drop in history.
22276017	World-wide, trading was generally manageable.
22276018	The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets, with blue chips there falling 12.8%.
22276019	In London, a midday rally left the market's major index off 3.2%, and Tokyo's leading stock index fell only 1.8% in surprisingly lackluster trading.
22276020	Other, more thinly traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo's, but there were no free-fall declines.
22276021	Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash: In this age of computerized trading, huge corrections or runups in a few hours' time must be expected.
22276022	What's more, such short-term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling.
22276023	Stephen Boesel, a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says, "There was less panic than in 1987: We had been through it once."
22276024	In Somerset, Wis., Adrian Sween, who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and isn't active in the stock market, agrees.
22276025	"I look at it as a ho-hum matter," he says.
22276026	Many other factors played a part in yesterday's comeback.
22276027	The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day.
22276028	Foreign stock markets, which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree, began the day off by relatively modest amounts.
22276029	The dollar, after falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen, bounced back strongly to 141.8, thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks.
22276030	And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash wasn't in store also helped calm investors.
22276031	Many major institutions, for example, came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday.
22276032	Still, amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday's events, some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday's.
22276033	"There is too much complacency," says money manager Barry Schrager.
22276034	Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide, so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe.
22276035	So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday's opening in Tokyo, where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start.
22276036	The average plunged some 600 points, or 1.7%, in the first 20 minutes of trading.
22276037	But the selling wave had no conviction, and the market first surged upward by 200 points, then drifted lower, closing down 647.
22276038	Unlike two years ago, most of Japan's major investors chose to sit this calamity out.
22276039	In Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Tokyo trading room, some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly, with few orders to process.
22276040	Clients "are all staying out" of the market, one Merrill trader says.
22276041	The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe.
22276042	Frankfurt's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders.
22276043	"The beginning was chaotic," says Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank
22276044	In London, the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm, Jefferies & Co., also was troubling.
22276045	A computer screen displaying 100 blue-chip stocks colors each one red when its price is falling.
22276046	The screen was a sea of red.
22276047	"I see concern, but I don't see panic," says J. Francis Palamara, a New Yorker who runs the 15-trader office.
22276048	London's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m. New York time, sending an encouraging message to Wall Street.
22276049	When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT, stocks fell sharply -- as expected.
22276050	Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points.
22276051	With sell orders piled up from Friday, about half the stocks in the Dow couldn't open on time.
22276052	By 9:45, the industrial average had dropped 27 points.
22276053	By 10 a.m., it was down 49.
22276054	Ten minutes later, the Dow hit bottom-down 63.52 points, another 2.5%.
22276055	But shortly before then, some of Wall Street's sharpest traders say, they sensed a turn.
22276056	"The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off," says Austin George, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price.
22276057	"It meant that people weren't running pell-mell to the safety of bonds."
22276058	Shortly after 10 a.m., the Major Market Index, a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA, exploded upward.
22276059	Stock traders were buoyed -- because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday.
22276060	"The MMI has gone better," shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
22276061	Shearson's London trading room went wild.
22276062	Traders shouted out as their Reuters, Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever-narrowing loss on Wall Street.
22276063	Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day.
22276064	"Rally, rally, rally," shouted Shearson's Andy Rosen.
22276065	"This is panic buying."
22276066	Major blue-chip stocks like Philip Morris, General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally.
22276067	Japanese were said to be heavy buyers.
22276068	German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co.
22276069	Then, traders say, corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear, triggering gains in, among other issues, Alcan Aluminium and McDonald's.
22276070	Walt Disney Co., which had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day, opened yesterday late at 114.5, down 8.5.
22276071	But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer, traders said.
22276072	By 10:25, the Dow had turned up for the day, prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors.
22276073	Among Big Board specialists, the cry was "Pull your offers" -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares.
22276074	"It was bedlam on the upside," said one Big Board specialist.
22276075	"What we had was a real, old-fashioned rally."
22276076	This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street's "black boxes," computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods.
22276077	Typical, perhaps, was Batterymarch's Dean LeBaron.
22276078	Mr. LeBaron, who manages $10 billion, says, "We turned the trading system on, and it did whatever it was programmed to do."
22276079	Asked what stocks the computer bought, the money manager says, "I don't know."
22276080	Not everybody was making money.
22276081	The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday.
22276082	Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses.
22276083	Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning.
22276084	"They were absolutely killed, slaughtered," said one Chicago-based options trader.
22276085	Meanwhile, a test of the stock market's rally came at about 2 p.m., with the Dow at 2600, up 31 points on the day.
22276086	Charles Clough, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, says bargain hunting had explained the Dow's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow.
22276087	Moreover, the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected to rattle traders.
22276088	Instead, the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying.
22276089	The market closed minutes after reaching its high for the day of
22276090	Across the country, many people took yesterday's events in stride, while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general.
22276091	Says James Norman, the mayor of Ava, Mo.: "I don't invest in stocks.
22276092	I much prefer money I can put my hands on."
22276093	While Mayor Norman found the market's performance Monday reassuring, he says, he remains uneasy.
22276094	"We have half the experts saying one thing and half the other" about the course of the economy.
22276095	Ralph Holzfaster, a farmer and farm-supply store operator in Ogallala, Neb., says of the last few days events, "If anything good comes out of this, it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids."
22276096	Says Gordon Fines, a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis, "You're on a roller coaster, and that may last.
22276097	The public is still cautious.
22277001	Skipper's Inc., Bellevue, Wash., said it signed a definitive merger agreement for a National Pizza Corp. unit to acquire the 90.6% of Skipper's Inc. it doesn't own for $11.50 a share, or about $28.1 million.
22277002	NP Acquisition Co., a National Pizza unit, plans to begin a tender offer for Skipper's on Friday, conditioned on at least two-thirds of Skipper's shares being tendered.
22277003	Pittsburg, Kan.-based National Pizza said the transaction will be financed under its revolving credit agreement.
22277004	In national over-the-counter trading, Skipper's shares rose 50 cents to $11.
22277005	Skipper's said the merger will help finance remodeling and future growth.
22277006	Skipper's previously turned down a $10-a-share proposal from National Pizza and Pizza Hut Inc. questioned whether the purchase would violate National Pizza's franchise agreements.
22277007	National Pizza said it settled its dispute with Pizza Hut, allowing it to make the purchase.
22277008	Also, Skipper's results began to turn around, permitting a higher offer, National Pizza said.
22277009	For the 12 weeks ended Sept. 3, Skipper's had net income of $361,000, or 13 cents a share, compared with a net loss a year earlier.
22277010	Revenue was $19.9 million.
22278001	EAST GERMANS RALLIED as officials reportedly sought Honecker's ouster.
22278002	In what was considered the largest protest in the Communist state's 40-year history, at least 120,000 demonstrators marched through the southern city of Leipzig to press demands for democratic freedoms, opposition activists said.
22278003	Police didn't intervene.
22278004	Meanwhile, as the first of more than 1,300 East Germans trying to flee to the West through Poland renounced their citizenship, a West German newspaper reported that regional Communist officials demanded the dismissal of hard-line leader Honecker.

22278008	House-Senate conferees approved a permanent smoking ban on domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on flights of less than six hours to Alaska and Hawaii.
22278009	The curbs would cover all but a small percentage of flights, and represent an expansion of the current ban on flights of less than two hours.
22278010	E. Robert Wallach was sentenced by a U.S. judge in New York to six years in prison and fined $250,000 for his racketeering conviction in the Wedtech scandal.
22278011	Wallach, an associate of ex-Attorney General Meese, was found guilty in August of taking $425,000 in illegal payoffs from the now-defunct defense contractor.
22278012	NASA resumed the countdown for today's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis, and a federal appeals court in Washington dismissed a lawsuit by anti-nuclear groups to delay the flight because the plutonium-powered Galileo space probe was aboard.
22278013	The space agency said it didn't expect weather or protesters to block the liftoff.
22278014	The Bush administration is preparing to extend a ban on federal financing of research using fetal tissue, government sources said.
22278015	A temporary prohibition was imposed in March 1988.
22278016	While anti-abortion groups are opposed to such research, scientists have said transplanting such tissue could be effective in treating diabetes.
22278017	Delegates from 91 nations endorsed a ban on world ivory trade in an attempt to rescue the endangered elephant from extinction.
22278018	Five African nations, however, said they would continue selling the valuable tusks.
22278019	Mubarak held reconciliation talks with Gadhafi at the Egyptian resort of Mersa Metruh.
22278020	It was the Libyan leader's first trip to Egypt in 16 years.
22278021	They announced a reduction in formalities for travel, but didn't show any real signs of resuming full diplomatic ties.
22278022	The Egyptian president said he would visit Libya today to resume the talks.
22278023	Seoul and Pyongyang reached a tentative agreement to allow visits between families on the divided Korean peninsula.
22278024	Such family reunions would be the second since 1945.
22278025	Differences remained between the North and South Korean governments, however, over conditions for the exchanges.
22278026	Freed black nationalists resumed political activity in South Africa and vowed to fight against apartheid, raising fears of a possible white backlash.
22278027	The nation's main white opposition party warned that the government's release Sunday of eight black political prisoners risked bringing chaos and eventual black Marxist rule to the nation.
22278028	The White House said Bush is "fully satisfied" with CIA Director Webster and the intelligence agency's performance during the Oct. 3 failed coup in Panama.

22279001	British retail sales volume rose a provisional 0.4% in September from August and was up 2.2% from September 1988, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
22279002	For the three months ended in September, retail sales volume was down 0.5% from the previous three months and up 1.2% from a year earlier.
22280001	Chicago investor William Farley agreed to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $600 million to Bidermann S.A., a closely held clothing maker based in Paris.
22280002	Shortly after completing the $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell Inc. in April, Mr. Farley's holding company, Farley Inc., said it was considering the sale of Cluett, a leading shirt maker and one of West Point-Pepperell's biggest units.
22280003	Included in the sale are Cluett units that make men's shirts under the Arrow name, socks under the Gold Toe name and menswear through the Schoeneman division.
22280004	The companies said the agreement is subject to Bidermann's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals.
22280005	They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November.
22280006	Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett's four main divisions plus other "anticipated" West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December, should bring in a total of about $700 million.
22280007	He didn't elaborate on other asset sales being considered.
22280008	Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets.
22280009	But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc., the underwear maker that he still controls and serves as chairman and chief executive.
22280010	Cluett was an independent company until West Point-Pepperell acquired it for $375 million in cash and stock in 1986.
22280011	In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Cluett had operating profit of $37 million on sales of $757 million.
22280012	Bidermann sells clothes under various labels, including Yves Saint Laurent and Bill Robinson for men and Ralph Lauren for women.
22280013	A spokesman said the company had sales of $400 million in 1988.
22280014	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, West Point-Pepperell fell 25 cents to $53.875.
22281001	Britain's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of U.S.-based Manpower Inc.
22281003	Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps, expected within a few months, as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5% drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings.
22281004	The name change and good will write-off could help solidify Blue Arrow's dominance of the U.S. temporary-help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday's market plunge.
22281005	U.S. holders now own more than 60% of Blue Arrow compared with 9% last January.
22281006	"In the U.S. market, the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow," Mr. Fromstein said.
22281007	The moves also could erase shareholders' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil.
22281008	"It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past," said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York.
22281009	The proposed changes "all make a lot of sense to me," he added.
22281010	In a widely publicized boardroom coup, Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January, a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $1 million-a-year chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower.
22281011	Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman.
22281012	But the Blue Arrow tumult isn't over yet, as the British government is investigating a disputed #25 million ($39.4 million) loan which Mr. Fromstein has said was made under Mr. Berry's direction.
22281013	Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies.
22281014	Under British rules, Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase.
22281015	As a U.S.-based company, Blue Arrow would have to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years, creating a continuing drag on reported earnings.
22281016	Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm, operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets.
22281017	But with so many shares now held in the U.S., Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways, based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards.
22281018	"Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice's wonderland," Mr. Fromstein said.
22281019	The British version shows "a handful of pounds of net worth" following the 1987 write-off of good will, while the American version reflects "$1 billion of net worth because almost none of {the good will} has been written off."
22281020	Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow's U.S. books in one fell swoop, but wouldn't specify how much.
22281021	People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk, with executives claiming prior management overstated the extent of Manpower's good will.
22281022	That move, along with the return to the Manpower name, could bolster the company's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help.
22281023	The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1% in the 12 months ending Aug. 31, after sliding nearly 3.5% in July, said Kidder Peabody's Mr. Arthur.
22281024	Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain.
22281025	Overall, pretax profit slid to #18.49 million in the quarter from #18.98 million a year earlier.
22282001	Richard G. Sim, the man credited with transforming Applied Power Inc. from an underachiever into a feisty player in the global market for hydraulic tools, hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company's latest acquisition, Barry Wright Corp.
22282002	The 45-year-old former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time.
22282003	But analysts, while applauding the acquisition, say Applied's chief executive faces a tough challenge in integrating the two companies.
22282004	Barry Wright, acquired by Applied for $147 million, makes computer-room equipment and vibration-control systems.
22282005	The Watertown, Mass., company's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped.
22282006	Last year's earnings of $1.3 million, including $815,000 from a restructuring gain, were far below the year-earlier $8.4 million.
22282007	Besides spurring Barry Wright's sales, which were $201.7 million in 1988, Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line.
22282008	"The question is how long it's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution," says F. John Mirek, an analyst at Blunt Ellis Loewi in Milwaukee.
22282009	The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim.
22282010	The Butler, Wis., manufacturer went public at $15.75 a share in August 1987, and Mr. Sim's goal then was a $29 per-share price by 1992.
22282011	Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule, in August 1988.
22282012	The stock has since softened, trading around $25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $23.00 in national over-the-counter trading.
22282013	But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $50 a share by the end of
22282014	Reaching that goal, says Robert T. Foote, Applied's chief financial officer, will require "efficient reinvestment" of cash by Applied and continuation of its healthy 19% rate of return on operating capital.
22282015	In Barry Wright, Mr. Sim sees a situation "very similar" to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985.
22282016	Applied, then a closely held company, was stagnating under the management of its controlling family.
22282017	While profitable, it "wasn't growing and wasn't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital," he says.
22282018	Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied.
22282019	He also professes an "evangelical" fervor to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where decision-making is shared.
22282020	Mr. Sim considers the new unit's operations "fundamentally sound" and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that haven't interested larger competitors.
22282021	"With a little patience, these businesses will perform very satisfactorily," Mr. Sim says.
22282022	Within about six months, "things will be moving in the right direction," he predicts.
22282023	Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he's now in the driver's seat.
22282024	When he came to Applied, "I didn't have the power to execute as I do today," he says.
22282025	He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November.
22282026	At Applied, Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective.
22282027	He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $12.6 million, which helped launch the company's acquisition program.
22282028	Sales climbed to an estimated $245 million in fiscal 1989, ended Aug. 31, from $99.9 million in fiscal 1985.
22282029	The company expects that earnings, which have marched steadily upward in recent years, reached about $20.8 million, or $1.58 a share, in the fiscal year just ended, up from $15.2 million in fiscal 1988 and $3.9 million in 1985.
22300001	No, it wasn't Black Monday.
22300002	But while the New York Stock Exchange didn't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos.
22300003	Some "circuit breakers" installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test, traders say, unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures.
22300004	The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again couldn't handle the selling pressure.
22300005	Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock, traders say.
22300006	Heavy selling of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward.
22300007	Seven Big Board stocks -- UAL, AMR, BankAmerica, Walt Disney, Capital Cities/ABC, Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group -- stopped trading and never resumed.
22300008	The finger-pointing has already begun.
22300009	"The equity market was illiquid.
22300010	Once again {the specialists} were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange," said Christopher Pedersen, senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp.
22300011	Countered James Maguire, chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Inc.: "It is easy to say the specialist isn't doing his job.
22300012	When the dollar is in a free-fall, even central banks can't stop it.
22300013	Speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market."
22300014	Many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early Friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet.
22300015	Then in a lightning plunge, the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year, chalking up a 190.58-point, or 6.9%, loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume.
22300016	Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares, a record for the Big Board.
22300017	At the end of the day, 251.2 million shares were traded.
22300018	The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2569.26.
22300019	The Dow's decline was second in point terms only to the 508-point Black Monday crash that occurred Oct. 19, 1987.
22300020	In percentage terms, however, the Dow's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83, or 8%, a week after Black Monday.
22300021	The Dow fell 22.6% on Black Monday.
22300022	Shares of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, were extremely active all day Friday, reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group.
22300023	Wall Street's takeover-stock speculators, or "risk arbitragers," had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise.
22300024	At 2:43 p.m. EDT, came the sickening news: The Big Board was halting trading in UAL, "pending news."
22300025	On the exchange floor, "as soon as UAL stopped trading, we braced for a panic," said one top floor trader.
22300026	Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed.
22300027	For weeks, the market had been nervous about takeovers, after Campeau Corp.'s cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers.
22300028	And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group couldn't get financing for its bid.
22300029	At this point, the Dow was down about 35 points.
22300030	The market crumbled.
22300031	Arbitragers couldn't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every "rumor" stock they had.
22300032	For example, their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group, which closed down 3 7/8 to 41 1/2, Delta Air Lines, which fell 7 3/4 to 69 1/4, and Philips Industries, which sank 3 to 21 1/2.
22300033	These stocks eventually reopened.
22300034	But as panic spread, speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses.
22300035	When trading was halted in Philip Morris, the stock was trading at 41, down 3 3/8, while IBM closed 5 5/8 lower at 102.
22300036	Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic "stop-loss" orders, which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels.
22300037	Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals, including computer-guided program traders.
22300038	Traders said most of their major institutional investors, on the other hand, sat tight.
22300039	Now, at 3:07, one of the market's post-crash "reforms" took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points, equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials.
22300040	Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading was temporarily halted in Chicago.
22300041	After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago, waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board, and specialists continued to notch prices down.
22300042	As a result, the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart.
22300043	Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board.
22300044	The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders.
22300045	"It screwed things up," said one major specialist.
22300046	This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading, stock index arbitrage, that closely links the futures and stock markets, and has been blamed by some for the market's big swings.
22300047	(In a stock-index arbitrage sell program, traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference.)
22300048	"When the airline information came through, it cracked every model we had for the marketplace," said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms.
22300049	"We didn't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do."
22300050	But stocks kept falling.
22300051	The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt.
22300052	At 3:30 p.m., at the end of the "cooling off" period, the average was down 114.76 points.
22300053	Meanwhile, during the the S&P trading halt, S&P futures sell orders began piling up, while stocks in New York kept falling sharply.
22300054	Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker "worked well mechanically.
22300055	I just think it's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things."
22300056	Under another post-crash system, Big Board President Richard Grasso (Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling) was talking on an "inter-exchange hot line" to the other exchanges, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board.
22300057	He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board, where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders.
22300058	At about 3:30 p.m. EDT, S&P futures resumed trading, and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line.
22300059	Buyers stepped in to the futures pit.
22300060	But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market, and the link with stocks began to fray again.
22300061	At about 3:45, the S&P market careened to still another limit, of 30 points down, and trading was locked again.
22300062	Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points.
22300063	During this time, small investors began ringing their brokers, wondering whether another crash had begun.
22300064	At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., which is trying to cater to small investors, some demoralized brokers thought this would be the final confidence-crusher.
22300065	That's when George L. Ball, chairman of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit, took to the internal intercom system to declare that the plunge was only "mechanical."
22300066	"I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something `more ado about less.'
22300067	It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell, to look for an opportunity to buy," Mr. Ball told the brokers.
22300068	At Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, a news release was prepared headlined "Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop."
22300069	The release cautioned that "there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987" and that there are still "attractive investment opportunities" in the stock market.
22300070	However, Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said that Friday's plunge is "going to set back" relations with customers, "because it reinforces the concern of volatility.
22300071	And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading.
22300072	It's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront."
22300073	As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday, the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit.
22300074	Jeffrey Yass of program trader Susquehanna Investment Group said 2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close, the equivalent of $330 million in stock.
22300075	But there were no buyers.
22300076	While Friday's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors, it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning, traders said.
22300077	Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself.
22300078	At those levels, stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers, who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall, and simultaneously sell off stocks.
22300079	But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today.
22300080	The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation.
22300081	The Big Board's Mr. Grasso said, "Our systemic performance was good."
22300082	But the exchange will "look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks.
22300083	Obviously we'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations weren't met," he said.
22300084	(See related story: "Fed Ready to Inject Big Funds" -- WSJ Oct. 16, 1989)
22300085	But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash, the "upstairs" firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday's blood-letting.
22300086	Mr. Phelan said, "It will take another day or two" to analyze who was buying and selling Friday.
22301001	Concerning your Sept. 21 page-one article on Prince Charles and the leeches: It's a few hundred years since England has been a kingdom.
22301002	It's now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, comprising Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and . . . oh yes, England, too.
22301003	Just thought you'd like to know.

22302001	Ports of Call Inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that weren't disclosed.
22302002	The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring.
22302003	The company said a portion of the $32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air-charter operations.
22302004	Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. 707s because of increasing maintenance costs.
22303001	A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co. said it has made a $409 million cash bid for most of L.J. Hooker Corp.'s real-estate and shopping-center holdings.
22303002	The $409 million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $300 million in secured liabilities on those properties, according to those making the bid.
22303003	The group is led by Jay Shidler, chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu, and A. Boyd Simpson, chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization Inc.
22303004	Mr. Shidler's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $1 billion in assets; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker.
22303005	"The assets are good, but they require more money and management" than can be provided in L.J. Hooker's current situation, said Mr. Simpson in an interview. "
22303006	Hooker's philosophy was to build and sell.
22303007	We want to build and hold."
22303008	L.J. Hooker, based in Atlanta, is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
22303009	Its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.
22303010	Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee.
22303012	Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co., L.J. Hooker's department-store chains.
22303013	The offer covers the massive 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati, the 800,000 square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C., and the 700,000 square-foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton, Colo.
22303014	The Thornton mall opened Sept. 19 with a Bigg's hypermarket as its anchor; the Columbia mall is expected to open Nov. 15.
22303015	Other Hooker properties included are a 20-story office tower in midtown Atlanta, expected to be completed next February; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio; L.J. Hooker International, the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate, plus other shopping centers.
22303016	The consortium was put together by Hoare Govett, the London-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp.
22303017	"We don't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid," said Allan Campbell, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett, in an interview.
22303018	Hoare Govett is acting as the consortium's investment bankers.
22303019	According to people familiar with the consortium, the bid was code-named Project Klute, a reference to the film "Klute" in which a prostitute played by actress Jane Fonda is saved from a psychotic businessman by a police officer named John Klute.
22303020	L.J. Hooker was a small home-building company based in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr. Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development.
22303021	The company grew modestly until 1986, when a majority position in Hooker Corp. was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu, currently Hooker's chairman.
22303022	Mr. Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious, but ill-fated, $1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co., as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers, a Sacramento chain; Sakowitz Inc., the Houston-based retailer, and Parisian Inc., the Southeast department-store chain.
22303023	Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company, and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988.
22303024	Since then, Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain.
22303025	In addition, Robert Sakowitz, chief executive of the Sakowitz chain, is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company.
22303026	The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corp.
22303027	Reached in Honolulu, Mr. Shidler said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management.
22303028	"These aren't mature assets, but they have the potential to be so," said Mr. Shidler.
22303029	"Managed properly, and with a long-term outlook, these can become investment-grade quality properties.
22304001	Canadian steel-ingot production totaled 291,890 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 7, up 14.8% from the preceding week's total of 254,280 tons, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
22304002	The week's total was up 6.2% from 274,963 tons a year earlier.
22304003	The year-to-date total was 12,006,883 tons, up 7.8% from 11,141,711 tons a year earlier.
22305001	The Treasury plans to raise $175 million in new cash Thursday by selling about $9.75 billion of 52-week bills and redeeming $9.58 billion of maturing bills.
22305002	The bills will be dated Oct. 26 and will mature Oct. 25, 1990.
22305003	They will be available in minimum denominations of $10,000.
22305004	Bids must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Thursday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
22306001	As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend, big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals: cash.
22306002	Unlike the weekend before Black Monday, the funds weren't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests.
22306003	And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week.
22306004	At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, telephone volume was up sharply, but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987.
22306005	The Boston firm said stock-fund redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago.
22306006	As of yesterday afternoon, the redemptions represented less than 15% of the total cash position of about $2 billion of Fidelity's stock funds.
22306007	"Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around," said C. Bruce Johnstone, who runs Fidelity Investments' $5 billion Equity-Income Fund.
22306008	"This feels more like a one-shot deal.
22306009	People aren't panicking."
22306010	The test may come today.
22306011	Friday's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act.
22306012	Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday's close would take place at today's closing prices.
22306013	Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle didn't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday.
22306014	But fund managers say they're ready.
22306015	Many have raised cash levels, which act as a buffer against steep market declines.
22306016	Mario Gabelli, for instance, holds cash positions well above 20% in several of his funds.
22306017	Windsor Fund's John Neff and Mutual Series' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20% and 30%, respectively, this year.
22306018	Even Peter Lynch, manager of Fidelity's $12.7 billion Magellan Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, built up cash to 7% or $850 million.
22306019	One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions, the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September.
22306020	"I've let the money build up," Mr. Lynch said, who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes.
22306021	Not all funds have raised cash levels, of course.
22306022	As a group, stock funds held 10.2% of assets in cash as of August, the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute.
22306023	That was modestly higher than the 8.8% and 9.2% levels in August and September of 1987.
22306024	Also, persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash.
22306025	But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around, fund managers said.
22306026	A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday.
22306027	Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months, but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels.
22306028	"There's not nearly as much froth," said John Bogle, chairman of Vanguard Group Inc., a big Valley Forge, Pa., fund company.
22306029	Many fund managers argue that now's the time to buy.
22306030	Vincent Bajakian, manager of the $1.8 billion Wellington Fund, added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb, Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday.
22306031	And today he'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly, Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines.
22306032	Fidelity's Mr. Lynch, for his part, snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered.
22306033	If the market drops further today, he said he'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg.
22306034	"If they croak stocks like that," he said, it presents an opportunity that is "the kind of thing you dream about."
22306035	Major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday.
22306036	But most investors were seeking share prices and other information.
22306037	Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal.
22306038	Still, fund groups aren't taking any chances.
22306039	They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987.
22306040	Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 walk-in investor centers across the country.
22306041	The centers normally are closed through the weekend.
22306042	In addition, East Coast centers will open at 7:30 EDT this morning, instead of the normal 8:30.
22306043	T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests.
22306044	The Baltimore-based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds.
22306045	But most investors seemed to be "in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode," said Steven Norwitz, a vice president.
22306046	And Vanguard, among other groups, said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through.
22306047	In an unusual move, several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines.
22306048	"We view {Friday's} market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors," a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend.
22306049	The Janus Group had a similar recording for investors.
22306050	Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize.
22306051	Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year's fat profits.
22306052	Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25% through September, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
22306053	Elaine Garzarelli, who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s $335 million Sector Analysis Portfolio, predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and "some panic selling."
22306054	But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market won't decline more than 10% to 15% from recent highs.
22306055	"This is not a major crash," she said.
22306056	Nevertheless, Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders.
22306057	"Half of them are really scared and want to sell," she said, "but I'm trying to talk them out of it."
22306058	She added, "If they all were bullish, I'd really be upset."
22306059	The backdrop to Friday's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash, fund managers argue.
22306060	Two years ago, unlike today, the dollar was weak, interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued, they say.
22306061	"From the investors' standpoint, institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson . . . by selling at the lows" on Black Monday, said Stephen Boesel, manager of the $580 million T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund.
22306062	This time, "I don't think we'll get a panic reaction.
22307001	Newport Corp. said it expects to report fiscal-first-quarter earnings of between 15 cents and 19 cents a share, somewhat below analysts' estimates of 19 cents to 23 cents.
22307002	The maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months.
22307003	A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the yearearlier quarter's figure, when Newport reported net income of $1.7 million, or 21 cents a share, on $14.1 million in sales.
22308001	Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker.
22308002	Peter Otradovec, vice president for planning at the Phoenix, Ariz., carrier, said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing, now entering its 13th day, "has caused some turmoil in our scheduling" and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines.
22308003	Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights, including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas.
22308004	Now, those routes aren't expected to begin until Jan.
22308005	Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year's end.
22308006	Those, too, are almost certain to arrive late.
22308007	At this point, no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio, Texas; Newark, N.J.; and Palmdale, Calif. -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries.
22308008	Nevertheless, the company's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy.
22308009	It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company.
22308010	"I just don't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout," Tom Baker, president of Machinists' District 751, said in an interview yesterday.
22308011	"I don't think their customers would like it very much."
22308012	America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be.
22308013	"I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all," Mr. Otradovec said.
22308014	Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations.
22308015	Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time.
22308016	"It's so close to completion, Boeing's told us there won't be a problem," said a Southwest spokesman.
22308017	A spokesman for AMR Corp. said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a 757 on time later this month.
22308018	American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and isn't anticipating any changes in that timetable.
22308019	In Seattle, a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike.
22308020	Meanwhile, supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company's Everett, Wash., plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout.
22308021	As of Friday, four had been delivered and a fifth plane, a 747-400, was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China.
22308022	No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table.
22308023	"We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back," said Doug Hammond, the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began.
22308024	The investment community, for one, has been anticipating a speedy resolution.
22308025	Though Boeing's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday, it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders.
22308026	"The market has taken two views: that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc.
22308027	Boeing's shares fell $4 Friday to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
22308028	But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month, hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week.
22308029	Still, he said, it's possible that the strike could last considerably longer.
22308030	"I wouldn't expect an immediate resolution to anything."
22308031	Last week, Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter, saying that "to my knowledge, Boeing's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history."
22308032	But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company's offer of a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus bonuses -- "very weak."
22308033	He added that the company miscalculated the union's resolve and the workers' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime.
22308034	In separate developments: -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the Calabasas, Calif., aerospace company.
22308035	The union is continuing to work through its expired contract, however.
22308036	It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday, but that has been pushed back indefinitely.
22308037	-- United Auto Workers Local 1069, which represents 3,000 workers at Boeing's helicopter unit in Delaware County, Pa., said it agreed to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis, with a 10-day notification to cancel, while it continues bargaining.
22308038	The accord expired yesterday.
22308039	-- And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $326 million.
22308040	The planes, long range versions of the medium-haul twin-jet, will be delivered with Pratt & Whitney PW4060 engines.
22308041	Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Inc.
22308042	Martinair Holland is based in Amsterdam.
22308043	A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out "for a variety of reasons, but not because of the strike."

22309001	Atco Ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants, some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars (US$851 million), in Great Britain and elsewhere.
22309002	C.S. Richardson, Atco's senior vice president, finance, said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada, and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere, including Britain, where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program.
22309003	"The projects are big.
22309004	They can be C$1 billion plus," Mr. Richardson said.
22309005	"But we wouldn't go into them alone," and Canadian Utilities' equity stake would be small, he said.
22309006	"Ideally, we'd like to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor.
22309007	Our long suit is our proven ability to operate" power plants, he said.
22309008	Mr. Richardson wouldn't offer specifics regarding Atco's proposed British project, but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities.
22309009	Britain's government plans to raise about #20 billion ($31.05 billion) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities, beginning next month.
22309010	The planned electric utility sale, scheduled for next year, is alone expected to raise #13 billion, making it the world's largest public offering.
22309011	Under terms of the plan, independent generators would be able to compete for 15% of customers until 1994, and for another 10% between 1994 and 1998.
22309012	Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$1.16 billion, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta, where the company serves about 800,000 customers.
22309013	"There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity," Mr. Richardson said, and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it.
22309014	"This is a real thrust on our utility side," he said, adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries, though he would be specific.
22309015	Canadian Utilities isn't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain, in anticipation of the privatization program.
22309016	"We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England," said Bruce Stram, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with Enron Corp., Houston, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator.
22309017	Mr. Stram said Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U.K. capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $300 million to $400 million.
22310001	PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $1.3 million to $1.7 million, or 14 cents to 18 cents a share.
22310002	In the year-ago quarter, the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $326,000, or four cents a share, on revenue of about $41.4 million.
22310003	The company said the improvement is related to additional cogeneration facilities that have been put into operation.
22311001	CONCORDE trans-Atlantic flights are $2,400 to Paris and $3,200 to London.
22311002	In a Centennial Journal article Oct. 5, the fares were reversed.
22312001	Diamond Shamrock Offshore Partners said it had discovered gas offshore Louisiana.
22312002	The well flowed at a rate of 2.016 million cubic feet of gas a day through a 16 64-inch opening at depths between 5,782 and 5,824 feet.
22312003	Diamond Shamrock is the operator, with a 100% interest in the well.
22312004	Diamond Shamrock Offshore's stock rose 12.5 cents Friday to close at $8.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
22313001	Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. said it formed a $53.4 million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in California suitable for residential development.
22313002	The partnership, Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership, is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp., a unit of Heitman Financial Corp., a real estate advisory, management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif.
22313003	Kaufman & Broad, a home building company, declined to identify the institutional investors.
22313004	The land to be purchased by the joint venture hasn't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development, and part of Kaufman & Broad's job will be to obtain such approvals.
22313005	The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development, but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices, which can result in sizable savings, said Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad.
22313006	"There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash.
22313007	Typically, developers option property, and then once they get the administrative approvals, they buy it," said Mr. Karatz, adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind.
22313008	"We usually operate in that conservative manner."
22313009	By setting up the joint venture, Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land, while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet, Mr. Karatz said.
22313010	The company is putting up only 10% of the capital, although it is responsible for providing management, planning and processing services to the joint venture.
22313011	"This is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company," Mr. Karatz said.
22314001	When the price of plastics took off in 1987, Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride.
22314002	The timing of Quantum's chief executive officer, John Hoyt Stookey, appeared to be nothing less than inspired, because he had just increased Quantum's reliance on plastics.
22314003	The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years.
22314004	Mr. Stookey said of the boom, "It's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks."
22314005	But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum's profit is plummeting.
22314006	Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter, compared with year-earlier profit of $99.8 million, or $3.92 a share, on sales of $724.4 million.
22314007	The stock, having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1, closed at $34.375 share, down $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
22314008	To a degree, Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life.
22314009	Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history, these producers now see their prices eroding.
22314010	Pricing cycles, to be sure, are nothing new for plastics producers.
22314011	And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them.
22314012	"We were all wonderful heroes last year," says an executive at one of Quantum's competitors.
22314013	"Now we're at the bottom of the heap."
22314014	At Quantum, which is based in New York, the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics.
22314015	Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp., the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986.
22314016	Mr. Stookey, 59 years old, declined to be interviewed for this article, but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction.
22314017	Quantum's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin, used to make garbage bags, milk jugs, housewares, toys and meat packaging, among other items.
22314018	In the U.S. polyethylene market, Quantum has claimed the largest share, about 20%.
22314019	But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co., Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings.
22314020	When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound, Quantum's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share, provided no other variables are changing.
22314021	In recent months the price of polyethylene, even more than that of other commodity plastics, has taken a dive.
22314022	Benchmark grades, which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring, have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents.
22314023	Meanwhile, the price of ethylene, the chemical building block of polyethylene, hasn't dropped nearly so fast.
22314024	That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly, because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs.
22314025	By many accounts, an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year.
22314026	China, which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene, abruptly halted them.
22314027	Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world, other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product.
22314028	Kenneth Mitchell, director of Dow's polyethylene business, says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up.
22314029	"People were even hoarding bags," he says.
22314030	Now producers hope prices have hit bottom.
22314031	They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks.
22314032	No one knows, however, whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle.
22314033	One doubter is George Krug, a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks.
22314034	Noting others' estimates of when price increases can be sustained, he remarks, "Some say October.
22314035	Some say November.
22314036	I say 1992."
22314037	He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers' plans to expand production capacity.
22314038	A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy.
22314039	The company is trying to carry out a three-year, $1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year.
22314040	At the same time, its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $240 million, largely because of debt taken on to pay a $50-a-share special dividend earlier this year.
22314041	Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders, because its stock price wasn't reflecting the huge profit increases.
22314042	Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation.
22314043	Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend, raised 36% to 75 cents a share only a year ago, has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts.
22314044	Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives.
22314045	But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance.
22314046	In any case, on the day of the meeting, Quantum's shares slid $2.625 to $36.625 in Big Board trading.
22314047	On top of everything else, Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris, Ill.
22314048	After an explosion idled the plant in June, the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it.
22314049	Then a second explosion occurred.
22314050	Two workers died and six remain in the hospital.
22314051	This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum's fortunes.
22314052	Until this year, the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards.
22314053	A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum's financial future.
22314054	When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand, calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward.
22314055	But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting.
22314056	"You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that," recalls Theodore Semegran, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer.
22314057	"And then you still have to negotiate."
22314058	Quantum hopes the Morris plant, where limited production got under way last week, will resume full operation by year's end.
22314059	The plant usually accounts for 20% to 25% of Quantum's polyethylene production and 50% of its ethylene production.
22314060	Not everything looks grim for Quantum.
22314061	The plant expansion should strengthen the company's sway in the polyethylene business, where market share is often taken through sheer capacity.
22314062	By lifting ethylene production, the expansion will also lower the company's raw material costs.
22314063	Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals, propane marketing.
22314064	Through a venture with its investment banker, First Boston Corp., Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Inc. in a transaction valued at $1.18 billion.
22314066	The largest, Suburban Propane, was already owned by Quantum.
22314067	Still, Quantum has a crisis to get past right now.
22314068	Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor.
22314070	Asked about a bid for Quantum, a BP spokesman says, "We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors, and I think that falls in that category.
22315001	RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time, just a month after moving 11 of the group's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta.
22315002	A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant, taken private earlier this year in a $25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit, and dismissing its 14 employees, in a move to save money.
22315003	The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms, FCB/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson.
22315004	"We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost," said the spokesman, who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time.
22315005	An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $140 million on network television time this year, down from roughly $200 million last year.
22315006	The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1, and the move won't affect RJR's print, radio and spot-television buying practices.
22315007	The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago, when RJR's previous management moved it to Atlanta, the company's headquarters before this summer.
22315008	One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because "there was supposed to be a future."
22315009	He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies.
22315010	The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season.
22315011	"The studies {on closing the unit} couldn't be completed until now," he said.
22315012	The group's president, Peter Chrisanthopoulos, wasn't in his office Friday afternoon to comment.
22316001	The U.S., which is finalizing its steel-import quotas, is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.
22316002	Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota, and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.
22316003	Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30.
22316004	Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990.
22316005	In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation.
22316006	Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers, with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which isn't included in the quota program.
22316007	Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel.
22316008	Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas.
22316009	The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas, known as voluntary restraint agreements, until March 31, 1992.
22316010	It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments.
22316011	The U.S. termed its plan, a "trade liberalization program," despite the fact that it is merely an extension.
22316012	Mexico, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.
22316013	South Korea, which had 1.9% under the previous quotas, is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%.
22316014	That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included.
22316015	Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share it has had in recent years.
22316016	The EC and Japan -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.
22316017	The EC steel industry, which has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.
22316018	Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%.
22316019	In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988.
22316020	But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984.
22316021	Japan, however, has agreed to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.
22316022	Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program.
22316023	The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.
22316024	The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.
22316025	That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance.
22316026	Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market to allocate.
22316027	These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries.
22317001	Elcotel Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results, but anticipates that several new products will lead to a "much stronger" performance in its second half.
22317002	Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $272,000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, ended Sept. 30.
22317003	Revenue totaled $5 million.
22317004	George Pierce, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $4 million.
22317005	The lower results, Mr. Pierce said, reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, Elcotel's primary business.
22317006	Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year, he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas.
22317007	Foremost among those is the company's entrance into the public facsimile business, Mr. Pierce said.
22317008	Within the next year, Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines, made by Minolta in Japan, in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country.
22317009	Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect, store and forward billing data.
22317010	Mr. Pierce said Elcotel should realize a minimum of $10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month.
22317011	Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls.
22317012	Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone, Mr. Pierce said, not just phones produced by Elcotel.
22317013	The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones, which don't accept coins, for use in hotel lobbies, office lobbies, hospitality lounges and similar settings.
22317014	Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month.
22318001	Britain's retail price index rose 0.7% in September from August and was up 7.6% for the year, the Central Statistical Office said.
22319001	Quest Medical Inc. said it adopted a shareholders' rights plan in which rights to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed as a dividend to shareholders of record as of Oct. 23.
22319002	The company said the plan wasn't adopted in response to any known offers for Quest, a maker and marketer of hospital products.
22319003	The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15% of the company's common stock or announces a tender offer.
22320001	Measuring cups may soon be replaced by tablespoons in the laundry room.
22320002	Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a superconcentrated detergent that will require only a few spoonfuls per washload.
22320003	The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds.
22320005	The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets.
22320006	"They don't want to get caught again," says one industry watcher.
22320007	Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say P&G's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November.
22320008	A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month.
22320009	She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others.
22320010	Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G.
22320011	The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack.
22320012	When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.
22320013	With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%.
22320014	While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders.
22320015	The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach.
22320016	With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine, believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry.
22320017	In the early 1980s, P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe.
22320018	But the product, which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped.
22320019	P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches, but they haven't sold well, despite the convenience.
22320020	But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading.
22320021	And retailers are expected to embrace the product, in part because it will take up less shelf space.
22320022	"When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better," says Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst at Salomon Bros.
22320023	But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case.
22320024	If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates.
22320025	Then retailers "will probably push the {less-established} brands out altogether," he says.
22320027	To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market.
22320028	Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S., but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker.
22320029	It also has a product-testing facility in California.
22320030	Some believe P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese.
22320031	"This is something P&G would do with or without Kao," says Mr. Zurkuhlen.
22321001	With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
22321003	Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.
22321004	Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
22321005	Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade.
22321006	He said such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents" in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
22321007	But Mrs. Hills, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, stressed that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action."
22321008	She added that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest."
22321009	How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months.
22321010	American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.
22321011	Many called it simply a contrast in styles.
22321012	But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.
22321013	Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.
22321014	And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.
22321015	Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's, Mrs. Hills replied: "I didn't hear every word he spoke, but as a general proposition, I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration."
22321016	Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory."
22321017	"I think my line has been very consistent," Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon.
22321018	"I am painted sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement.
22321019	I don't feel very ferocious.
22321020	I don't feel either hard or soft.
22321021	I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade."
22321022	When she met the local press for the first time on Friday, Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.
22321023	She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified.
22321024	But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.
22321025	She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled by setting quantitative targets.
22321026	At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief.
22321027	"My impression was that you would be a scary old lady," he said, drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues.
22321028	"But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."
22321029	Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.
22321030	The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.
22321031	Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.
22321032	At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said, "I believe we can do much better than 20%."
22321033	But she stressed, "I am against managed trade.
22321034	I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market.
22322001	Traditional Industries Inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended June 30 and is seeking new financing.
22322002	The seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives, including seeking increases in its credit lines.
22322003	Traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and wouldn't say if it expects to show a profit for the year.
22322004	In the year ended June 30, 1988, Traditional reported net income of $4.9 million, or $1.21 a share.
22322005	The company didn't break out its fourth-quarter results.
22322006	In the latest nine months net income was $4.7 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $44.3 million.
22322007	Separately, the company said it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission "within approximately 45 days."
22322008	It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.
22322009	Under an agreement filed in federal court in August to settle FTC objections to some Traditional sales practices, Traditional said it would establish a $250,000 trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers.
22323001	Information International Inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized newspaper-publishing system, alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system.
22323002	A spokesman for Information International said the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system's about $3 million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure to pay royalties.
22323003	Information International said it believes that the complaints, filed in federal court in Georgia, are without merit.
22323004	Closely held Morris Communications is based in Augusta, Ga.
22323005	The units that filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co.
22324001	Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary, a men's luxury haberdashery, to Luxco Investments.
22324002	Terms weren't disclosed.
22324003	As Syms's "core business of off-price retailing grows, a small subsidiary that is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction," said Marcy Syms, president of the parent, in a statement.
22324004	A spokeswoman said Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas.
22325001	The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year.
22325002	Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability.
22325003	The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say, reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance.
22325004	The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals," Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said in an interview.
22325005	"That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general, he added.
22325006	He didn't forecast Phillips's results.
22325007	But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings.
22325008	So, too, many analysts predict, will Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.
22325009	Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies.
22325010	It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound.
22325011	A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents, peaking at about 34 cents last December.
22325012	A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion.
22325013	Beginning in mid-1987, prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand.
22325014	Companies added capacity furiously.
22325015	Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market, while the dollar is stronger, and domestic economic growth is slower.
22325016	Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker.
22325017	"Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year," said William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp.
22325018	Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that didn't materialize.
22325019	The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period.
22325020	In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier, further pressuring profitability.
22325021	Refiners say margins picked up in September, and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter.
22325022	During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.
22325023	Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year.
22325024	Prices -- averaging roughly $2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies' expectations.
22325025	Demand has been much stronger than anticipated, and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter.
22325026	"We could see higher oil prices this year," said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
22325027	That will translate into sharply higher production profits, particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $13 a barrel in the fourth quarter.
22325028	While oil prices have been better than expected, natural gas prices have been worse.
22325029	In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less than they were in 1988.
22325030	The main reason remains weather.
22325031	Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use.
22325032	This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.
22325033	"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices," said Mr. Cox, Phillips's president.
22325034	"The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected."
22325035	Going into the fourth quarter, natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% lower than a year earlier.
22325036	For instance, natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $1.47 a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from $1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago.
22326001	The Bush administration, trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc, is questioning whether Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets.
22326002	Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies, are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.
22326003	They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools, computers and other high-technology products.
22326004	But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization.
22326005	To make its point, it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft.
22326006	The London Sunday Times, which first reported the U.S. concerns, cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry."
22326007	Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984.
22326008	A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom, but declined to confirm any details.
22326009	Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules.
22326010	President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.
22326011	Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules, asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the Italian authorities.
22326012	Although the legality of these sales is still an open question, the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community.
22326013	"It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting," said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies.
22326014	The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies, reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies.
22326015	Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.
22326016	But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.
22326017	However, these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization.
22326018	"There's no evidence that the Soviet program to (illegally) acquire Western technology has diminished," said a State Department spokesman.
22327001	Salomon Brothers International Ltd., a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc., announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.
22327002	The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.
22327003	Under the latest offer, HK$62.5 million (US$8 million) of three-year warrants will be issued in London, each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday.
22327004	The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26%.
22327005	In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, the shares closed Wednesday at HK$4.80 each.
22327006	At this price, the shares would have to rise above HK$6.05 for subscribers to Salomon's issue to profitably convert their warrants.
22327007	While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares, Salomon's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party.
22327008	Salomon will "cover" the warrants by buying sufficient shares, or options to purchase shares, to cover its entire position.
22327009	Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors, wary of volatility in the colony's stock market, an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk.
22327010	The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe, the bankers added, because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal.
22328001	Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $284 million in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
22328002	In a suit filed in federal court Thursday, the S&L alleged that a "disproportionate number" of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value.
22328003	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds, the suit alleged, after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51% stake in the thrift for about $34 million.
22328004	Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky, who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations.
22328005	Officials at Drexel said they hadn't seen the suit and thus couldn't comment.
22328006	In addition to $33 million compensatory damages, the suit seeks $100 million in punitive damages.
22328007	Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp., the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels.
22328008	Northview officials couldn't be located.
22328009	Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds.
22328010	Shortly before the visit, Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51% stake in the company.
22328011	However, the agreement was canceled in June 1984.
22328012	Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $11 million in losses on them, the company said.
22329001	Ideal Basic Industries Inc. said its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that will leave Ideal's minority shareholders with 12.8% of the combined company.
22329002	HOFI, the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd., previously proposed combining its 100% stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60% stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67% stake in Ideal.
22329003	But HOFI's first offer would have given Ideal's other shareholders about 10% of the combined company.
22329004	Ideal's directors rejected that offer, although they said they endorsed the merger proposal.
22329005	Under the agreement, HOFI will own 87.2% of the combined company.
22329006	Ideal's current operations will represent about 39.2% of the combined company.
22329007	The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders.
22329008	Ideal said it expects to complete the transaction early next year.
22330001	While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988, wheat prices remain stubbornly high.
22330002	And they're likely to stay that way for months to come, analysts say.
22330003	For one thing, even with many farmers planting more winter wheat this year than last, tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990, the analysts say.
22330004	And if rain doesn't fall soon across many of the Great Plains' wheat-growing areas, yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced, further squeezing supplies.
22330005	Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months.
22330006	By next May 31, stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested -- are projected to drop to 443 million bushels.
22330007	That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s.
22330008	Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year.
22330009	In response to dwindling domestic supplies, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments.
22330010	The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels.
22330011	It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels, compared with this year's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988.
22330012	But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted won't be felt until the second half of next year.
22330013	Until then, limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $4-a-bushel level, analysts say.
22330014	On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, wheat for December delivery settled at $4.0675 a bushel, unchanged.
22330015	In theory at least, tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze, said Daniel Basse, a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago.
22330016	Such a situation can wreak havoc, as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade.
22330017	In July, the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans.
22330018	The exchange said it feared that some members wouldn't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate, which had refused requests to reduce its holdings.
22330019	Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market.
22330020	Unseasonably hot, dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season's winter wheat crop, said Conrad Leslie, a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago.
22330021	For example, in the Oklahoma panhandle, 40% or more of the topsoil is short of moisture.
22330022	That figure climbs to about 47% in wheat-growing portions of Kansas, he said.
22330023	The Soviet Union hasn't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans, but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months, further supporting prices.
22330024	"Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand" in coming weeks, predicted Richard Feltes, vice president, research, for Refco Inc. in Chicago.
22330025	Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
22330026	Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go.
22330027	Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop.
22330028	It was near the low range of estimates, at 130 million 90-pound boxes, compared with 146.6 million boxes last season.
22330029	However, as expected, Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $1.34 a pound from around $1.55.
22330030	Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time.
22330031	It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $1.3210 a pound.
22330032	Brazilian juice, after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season, is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities.
22330033	Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product, which is going to be in plentiful supply.
22330034	The price cut, one analyst said, appeared to be aimed even more at Europe, where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen.
22330035	It's a dollar-priced product, and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe, the analyst said.
22330036	New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $2 a pound at midyear.
22330037	Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas, downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January, when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak, the analyst said.
22330038	Energy
22330039	Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday's leap in crude oil prices, last week's rally is generally expected to continue this week.
22330040	"I would continue to look for a stable crude market, at least in futures" trading, said William Hinton, an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co.
22330041	Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets.
22330042	On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $20.89 a barrel, up 42 cents on the day.
22330043	On European markets, meanwhile, spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel.
22330044	"This market still wants to go higher," said Nauman Barakat, a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
22330045	He predicted that the November contract will reach $21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
22330046	There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets.
22330047	Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes.
22330048	There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and can't produce as much as it could sell.
22330049	Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies, particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria.
22331001	If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co., co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt, an official close to the company said.
22331002	Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market.
22331003	But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant, which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi, has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks.
22331004	Last week, Saatchi's largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring.
22331005	And Carl Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Saatchi's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit, said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company, but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi.
22331006	Mr. Spielvogel said he wouldn't launch a hostile bid.
22331007	The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that "if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer, a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it couldn't beat, it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders.
22331008	But {otherwise} it would undoubtedly come back" with an offer by management.
22331009	The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board, whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi.
22331010	Mr. Spielvogel isn't part of the board, nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi's big U.S.-based ad agencies.
22331011	The executive didn't name any price, but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $1.3 billion.
22331012	The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back.
22331013	That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1.
22331014	Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc., has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi's poor financial state.
22331015	Asked about the speculation that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy-out by the brothers, the executive replied, "That isn't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in.
22331016	He was brought in to turn around the company."
22331017	Separately, several Saatchi agency clients said they believe the company's management shakeup will have little affect on them.
22331018	"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to," said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel.
22331019	John Lampe, director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc., a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client, said: "We have no problem with the announcement, because we don't know what change it's going to bring about.
22331020	We aren't going to change agencies because of a change in London."
22331021	Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc., as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co., also said they saw no effect.
22331022	Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account, declined comment.
22331023	Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring, or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone, led by him.
22331024	Ad Notes. . . .
22331025	NEW ACCOUNT:
22331026	California's Glendale Federal Bank awarded its $12 million to $15 million account to the Los Angeles office of Omnicom Group's BBDO agency.
22331027	The account was previously handled by Davis, Ball & Colombatto Advertising Inc., a Los Angeles agency.
22331028	ACCOUNT REVIEW:
22331029	Royal Crown Cola Co. has ended its relationship with the Boston office of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.
22331030	The account had billed about $6 million in 1988, according to Leading National Advertisers.
22331031	NOT-GUILTY PLEA:
22331032	As expected, Young & Rubicam Inc. along with two senior executives and a former employee, pleaded not guilty in federal court in New Haven, Conn., to conspiracy and racketeering charges.
22331033	The government has charged that they bribed Jamaican officials to win the Jamaica Tourist Board ad account in 1981.
22331034	A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office said extradition proceedings are "just beginning" for the other two defendants in the case, Eric Anthony Abrahams, former Jamaican tourism minister, and Jamaican businessman Arnold Foote Jr.
22331035	KOREAN AGENCY:
22331036	The Samsung Group and Bozell Inc. agreed to establish a joint venture advertising agency in South Korea.
22331037	Bozell Cheil Corp., as the new agency will be called, will be based in Seoul and is 70% owned by Samsung and 30% owned by Bozell.
22331038	Samsung already owns Korea First Advertising Co., that country's largest agency.
22331039	Bozell joins Backer Spielvogel Bates and Ogilvy Group as U.S. agencies with interests in Korean agencies.
22332001	Citing a payment from a supplier and strong sales of certain data-storage products, Maxtor Corp. said earnings and revenue jumped in its second quarter ended Sept. 24.
22332002	The maker of computer-data-storage products said net income rose to $4.8 million, or 23 cents a share, from year-earlier net of $1.1 million, or five cents a share.
22332003	Revenue soared to $117 million from $81.5 million.
22332004	Maxtor said its results were boosted by $2 million in payments received from a supplier, for a certain line of products that Maxtor isn't going to sell anymore.
22332005	Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue.
22332006	A spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate, but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit.
22332007	Operationally, Maxtor benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high-end personal computers and computer workstations.
22332008	In the fiscal first half, net was $7 million, or 34 cents a share, up from the year-earlier $3.1 million, or 15 cents a share.
22332009	Revenue rose to $225.5 million from $161.8 million.
22333001	Robert G. Walden, 62 years old, was elected a director of this provider of advanced technology systems and services, increasing the board to eight members.
22333002	He retired as senior vice president, finance and administration, and chief financial officer of the company Oct. 1.
22334001	Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that the filing doesn't include its audited financial statements and related information.
22334002	The real estate and thrift concern, operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings, said it told the SEC it couldn't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension "without unreasonable burden or expense."
22334003	The company asked for a 15-day extension Sept. 30, when the financial reports were due.
22334004	Southmark said it plans to amend its 10K to provide financial results as soon as its audit is completed.
22335001	Alan Seelenfreund, 52 years old, was named chairman of this processor of prescription claims, succeeding Thomas W. Field Jr., 55, who resigned last month.
22335002	Mr. Field also had been chairman of McKesson Corp., resigning that post after a dispute with the board over corporate strategy.
22335003	Mr. Seelenfreund is executive vice president and chief financial officer of McKesson and will continue in those roles.
22335004	PCS also named Rex R. Malson, 57, executive vice president at McKesson, as a director, filling the seat vacated by Mr. Field.
22335005	Messrs. Malson and Seelenfreund are directors of McKesson, which has an 86% stake in PCS.
22336001	MedChem Products Inc. said a U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U.S. patent held by Pharmacia Inc. was "without merit."
22336002	Pharmacia, based in Upsala, Sweden, had charged in a lawsuit against MedChem that MedChem's AMVISC product line infringes on the Pharmacia patent.
22336003	The patent is related to hyaluronic acid, a rooster-comb extract used in eye surgery.
22336004	In its lawsuit, Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block MedChem from selling the AMVISC products.
22336005	A MedChem spokesman said the products contribute about a third of MedChem's sales and 10% to 20% of its earnings.
22336006	In the year ended Aug. 31, 1988, MedChem earned $2.9 million, or 72 cents a share, on sales of $17.4 million.
22336007	MedChem said the court's ruling was issued as part of a "first-phase trial" in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case.
22336008	It said it is considering "all of its options in light of the decision, including a possible appeal."
22336009	The medical-products company added that it plans to "assert its other defenses" against Pharmacia's lawsuit, including the claim that it hasn't infringed on Pharmacia's patent.
22336010	MedChem said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday -- to set a date for proceedings on Pharmacia's motion for a preliminary injunction.
22337001	Newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results, aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage, especially in the Northeast.
22337002	Adding to unsteadiness in the industry, seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry.
22337003	In New York, the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, while the R.H. Macy & Co., Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue department-store chains are for sale.
22337004	Many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in classified-ad spending, a booming category for newspapers in recent years.
22337005	Until recently, industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year's third and fourth quarters.
22337006	All bets are off, analysts say, because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains.
22337007	"Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage, but the retailers' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run," said Edward J. Atorino, industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.
22337008	"Retailers are just in disarray."
22337009	For instance, Gannett Co. posted an 11% gain in net income, as total ad pages dropped at USA Today, but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates.
22337010	Gannett's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3% increase in advertising and circulation revenue.
22337011	Total advertising linage was "modestly" lower as classified-ad volume increased, while there was "softer demand" for retail and national ad linage, said John Curley, Gannett's chief executive officer.
22337012	At USA Today, ad pages totaled 785 for the quarter, down 9.2% from the 1988 period, which was helped by increased ad spending from the Summer Olympics.
22337013	While USA Today's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled 2,735, a decrease of 4% from last year, the paper's ad revenue increased 8% in the quarter and 13% in the nine months.
22337014	In the nine months, Gannett's net rose 9.5% to $270 million, or $1.68 a share, from $247 million, or $1.52 a share.
22337015	Revenue gained 6% to $2.55 billion from $2.4 billion.
22337016	At Dow Jones & Co., third-quarter net income fell 9.9% from the year-earlier period.
22337017	Net fell to $28.8 million, or 29 cents a share, from $32 million, or 33 cents a share.
22337018	The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $3.5 million, or four cents a share.
22337019	Revenue gained 5.3% to $404.1 million from $383.8 million.
22337020	The drop in profit reflected, in part, continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine.
22337021	Ad linage at the Journal fell 6.1% in the third quarter.
22337022	Affiliated Publications Inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss.
22337023	The publisher of the Boston Globe reported net of $8.5 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $26.5 million, or 38 cents a share, for the third quarter in 1988.
22337024	William O. Taylor, the parent's chairman and chief executive officer, said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the Boston newspaper.
22337025	Third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint, which in the last two years has had several price increases.
22337026	After a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14% since 1986 to $650 a metric ton, analysts are encouraged, because they don't expect a price increase for the rest of this year.
22337027	Companies with daily newspapers in the Northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage.
22337028	Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Co.'s earnings were down for the third quarter, because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers.
22337029	Trouble on the East Coast was likely offset by improved ad linage at the Los Angeles Times, which this week also unveiled a redesign.
22337030	New York Times Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate, Forest Products Group.
22337031	"Times Co.'s regional daily newspapers are holding up well, but there is little sign that things will improve in the New York market," said Alan Kassan, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
22337032	Washington Post Co. is expected to report improved earnings, largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area.
22337033	According to analysts, profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at Newsweek.
22337034	The news-weekly has faced heightened competition from rival Time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market.
22337035	Knight-Ridder Inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its Detroit Free Press and Gannett's Detroit News, and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter.
22337036	However, analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers, such as the Miami Herald and San Jose Mercury News.
22337037	"The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years" when Knight-Ridder "was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling," said Bruce Thorp, an analyst for Provident National Bank.
22338001	General Motors Corp., in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada, has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity.
22338002	In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.
22338003	GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.
22338004	The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.
22338005	Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987.
22338006	Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s.
22338007	One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match.
22338008	Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year.
22338009	GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin.
22338010	The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.
22338011	Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.
22338012	The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information," Mr. Yokich said.
22338013	GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves: Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.
22338014	That means two plants -- one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.
22338015	The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.
22338016	Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
22338017	But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec.
22338018	Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars.
22338019	GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec, company and union officials said.
22338020	That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures.
22338021	The Van Nuys plant, which employs about 3,000 workers, doesn't have a product to build after 1993.
22338022	Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a "flex plant," which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand.
22338023	At the Oklahoma City plant, which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars, Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said the plant has no new product lined up, and "none of us knows" when the A-body cars will die.
22338024	He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s.
22338025	At Pontiac, however, the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied, two-seater Pontiac Fiero model.
22338026	The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year.
22338027	Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result.
22338028	Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation's failure.
22339001	Institut Merieux S.A. of France said the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of Connaught BioSciences Inc. for 942 million Canadian dollars (US$801.6 million).
22339002	Merieux said the government's minister of industry, science and technology told it that he wasn't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of "net benefit" to Canada.
22339003	Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard.
22339004	The French company said the government gave it 30 days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan.
22339005	Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns.
22339006	The government's action was unusual.
22339007	Alan Nymark, executive vice president of Investment Canada, which oversees foreign takeovers, said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company.
22339008	He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns, but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed.
22339009	"This isn't a change in government policy; this provision has been used before," said Jodi Redmond, press secretary for Harvie Andre, Canada's minister of industry, science and technology.
22339010	Mr. Andre issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada.
22339011	Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they hadn't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada, but added they hope to have more information early this week.
22339012	Investment Canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision.
22339013	Viren Mehta, a partner with Mehta & Isaly, a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm, said the government's ruling wasn't unexpected.
22339014	"This has become a very politicized deal, concerning Canada's only large, world-class bio-research or pharmaceutical company," Mr. Mehta said.
22339015	Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught's dispute with the University of Toronto.
22339016	The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests, citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada.
22339017	The university is considering a settlement proposal made by Connaught.
22339018	While neither side will disclose its contents, Mr. Mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than Merieux offered to Investment Canada.
22339019	Some analysts, such as Murray Grossner of Toronto-based Richardson Greenshields Inc., believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders, such as Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif.
22339020	Officials for the two concerns, which are bidding C$30 a share for Connaught, couldn't be reached for comment.
22339021	French state-owned Rhone-Poulenc S.A. holds 51% of Merieux.
22340001	Weatherford International Inc. said it canceled plans for a preferred-stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock, and added that it expects to publicly offer about 10 million common shares.
22340002	The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding.
22340003	The exchange ratio was never established.
22340004	Weatherford said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange.
22340005	The energy-services concern said, however, that in January 1990, it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock.
22340006	Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it hasn't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $6 million, but will do so some time in the future.
22340007	Additionally, the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock, expected to be offered in November.
22340008	The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., underwriters for the offering, were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments.
22340009	Proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt.
22340010	Weatherford currently has approximately 11.1 million common shares outstanding.
22341001	Earnings for most of the nation's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter, as companies with newer, big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well.
22341002	For the third consecutive quarter, however, most of the companies' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency translations as a result of the strong dollar abroad.
22341003	Analysts said that Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new, higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins.
22341004	Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies' older products, many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines.
22341005	Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings, such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs.
22341006	As a result, "major new products are having significant impact, even on a company with very large revenues," Mr. Riccardo said.
22341007	Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers, as a group, is estimated to have climbed between 11% and 14%.
22341008	While that's not spectacular, Neil Sweig, an analyst with Prudential Bache, said that the rate of growth will "look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward."
22341009	Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck's profit for the quarter rose by about 22%, propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs, including its anti-cholesterol drug, Mevacor; a high blood pressure medicine, Vasotec; Primaxin, an antibiotic, and Pepcid, an anti-ulcer medication.
22341010	Profit climbed even though Merck's sales were reduced by "one to three percentage points" as a result of the strong dollar, Mr. Sweig said.
22341011	In the third quarter of 1988, Merck earned $311.8 million, or 79 cents a share.
22341012	In Rahway, N.J., a Merck spokesman said the company doesn't make earnings projections.
22341013	Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20%, largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac.
22341014	The drug, introduced last year, is expected to generate sales of about $300 million this year.
22341015	"It's turning out to be a real blockbuster," Mr. Sweig said.
22341016	In last year's third quarter, Lilly earned $171.4 million, or $1.20 a share.
22341017	In Indianapolis, Lilly declined comment.
22341018	Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert's profit also to increase by more than 20% from $87.7 million, or $1.25 a share, it reported in the like period last year.
22341019	The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins.
22341020	The company's lean operation, analysts said, allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug, Lopid, to power earnings growth.
22341021	Lopid sales are expected to be about $300 million this year, up from $190 million in 1988.
22341022	In Morris Plains, N.J., a spokesman for the company said the analysts' projections are "in the ballpark."
22341023	Squibb's profit, estimated by analysts to be about 18% above the $123 million, or $1.25 a share, it earned in the third quarter of 1988, was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease.
22341024	The company was officially merged with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month.
22341025	Bristol-Myers declined to comment.
22341026	Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp.'s expected profit rise of about 18% to 20%, and Bristol-Meyers's expected profit increase of about 13% are largely because "those companies are really managed well."
22341027	ScheringPlough earned $94.4 million, or 84 cents a share, while Bristol-Myers earned $232.3 million, or 81 cents a share, in the like period a year earlier.
22341028	In Madison, N.J., a spokesman for Schering-Plough said the company has "no problems" with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19%, to $1.
22341029	The company expects to achieve the 20% increase in full-year earnings per share, as it projected in the spring, the spokesman said.
22341030	Meanwhile, analysts said Pfizer's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued, as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5%.
22341031	Sales of Pfizer's important drugs, Feldene for treating arthritis, and Procardia, a heart medicine, have shrunk because of increased competition.
22341032	"The (strong) dollar hurt Pfizer a lot, too," Mr. Sweig said.
22341033	In the third quarter last year, Pfizer earned $216.8 million, or $1.29 a share.
22341034	In New York, the company declined comment.
22341035	Analysts said they expected Upjohn's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2% to 4% as compared with $89.6 million, or 49 cents a share, it earned a year ago.
22341036	Upjohn's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Halcion, a sedative.
22341037	Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs.
22341038	Also, the company's hair-growing drug, Rogaine, is selling well -- at about $125 million for the year, but the company's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising, analysts said.
22341039	In Kalamazoo, Mich., Upjohn declined comment.
22342001	Amid a crowd of crashing stocks, Relational Technology Inc.'s stock fell particularly hard Friday, dropping 23% because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter.
22342002	The database software company said it expects a $2 million net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30.
22342003	It said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period.
22342004	Revenue is expected to be "up modestly" from the $26.5 million reported a year ago.
22342005	Relational Technology reported net income of $1.5 million, or 12 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
22342006	"While our international operations showed strong growth, our domestic business was substantially below expectations," said Paul Newton, president and chief executive officer.
22342007	A spokesman said the company's first quarter is historically soft, and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales.
22342008	Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson, vice president of corporate sales, and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned.
22342009	The company said Mr. Wilson's resignation wasn't related to the sales shortfall.
22342010	Relational Technology went public in May 1988 at $14 a share.
22342011	It fell $1.875 a share Friday, to $6.25, a new low, in over-the-counter trading.
22342012	Its high for the past year was $16.375 a share.
22342013	In the previous quarter, the company earned $4.5 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $47.2 million.
22343001	The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy (on Arthur Avenue) and, of course, the Yankees.
22343002	However, most people, having been subjected to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did in "Bonfire of the Vanities" -- as a wrong turn into hell.
22343003	But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.
22343004	In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements" (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell-kitten Diana, age five).
22343005	Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.
22343006	She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
22343007	In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings "glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.
22343008	For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: ". . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures."
22343009	Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.
22343010	Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really wasn't ordinary.
22343011	She was raised, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie, whom she remembers as a loving liar, who realigned history to explain why Lily's father didn't live with them.
22343012	Rosie reinvented this man, who may or may not have known about his child, as a war hero for Lily's benefit.
22343013	Rosie died young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.
22343014	The games Bronx children played (holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure.
22343015	"Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes.
22343016	She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.
22343017	Her friend Susan, whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor.
22343018	Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they didn't seem to have any bedrooms at all.
22343019	Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting.
22343020	When Rosie died, her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.
22343021	They painted the apartment orange, pink and white, according to her instructions.
22343022	With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist (who rhymed river with liver in a love song); and Uncle Len, a mysterious part-time investigator who looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, like an "undercover President on a good-will mission."
22343023	They came by their strangeness honestly.
22343024	Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress, "Philosophy for Women."
22343025	The book loses some momentum toward the end, when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family.
22343026	For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.
22343027	The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel, which flashes back to the New York of the '50s.
22343028	But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95) feel cramped and static.
22343029	For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns."
22343030	Harry is now a 57-year-old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch.
22343031	Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong.
22343032	"An L.A. solution," explains Mr. Friedman.
22343033	Line by line Mr. Friedman's weary cynicism can be amusing, especially when he's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way people size each other up, immediately canceling the desperate ones who merely almost made it.
22343034	Harry has avoided all that by living in a Long Island suburb with his wife, who's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels she barely seems to notice when her husband disappears for drug-seeking forays into Manhattan.
22343035	But it doesn't take too many lines to figure Harry out.
22343036	He's a bore.
22344001	Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said it agreed to pay $1.5 million as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter the company formerly operated in Idaho.
22344002	In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources, which was a part-owner of the smelter, that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program.
22344003	The 21-square-mile area is contaminated with lead, zinc and other metals.
22344004	Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern, potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter's cleanup costs.
22344005	The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA, it "made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization."
22344006	The company, which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday, said that $1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement.
22344007	The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval, the company said.
22344008	Gulf Resources added that it "will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the Superfund law."
22344009	Under the agreement, Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock.
22344010	The company's net worth cannot fall below $185 million after the dividends are issued.
22344011	"The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf's reorganization, which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990," said Lawrence R. Mehl, Gulf's general counsel.
22344012	In addition, Gulf must give the government 20 days' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $50 million that are made to the Bermuda-based holding company.
22344013	Gulf's net worth after those transaction must be at least $150 million.
22344014	Separately, the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 to vote on its proposed reorganization.
22345001	Many of the nation's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players.
22345002	Assuming that the market doesn't head into a bottomless free fall, some executives think Friday's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating.
22345003	"This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations, rather than to any fundamentals," said John Young, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., whose shares dropped $3.125 to $48.125.
22345004	"If we get rid of a lot of that nonsense, it will be a big plus."
22345005	A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council, a group that meets to discuss national issues, were only too happy to personalize their criticism.
22345006	"People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs, do something about takeovers, do something about Donald Trump," said Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., whose stock dropped $3.375.
22345007	"Where's the leadership?
22345008	Where's the guy who can say: `Enough is enough'"?
22345009	The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes.
22345010	"I'm not going to worry about one day's decline," said Kenneth Olsen, Digital Equipment Corp. president, who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company's shares plunged $5.75 to close at $86.50.
22345011	"I didn't bother calling anybody; I didn't even turn on TV."
22345012	"There hasn't been any fundamental change in the economy," added John Smale, whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $8.75 slide to close at $120.75.
22345013	"The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this won't be a problem."
22345014	Of course, established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists.
22345015	Indeed, one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday's events was Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump.
22345016	Asked whether Friday's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate, Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said: "No comment."
22345017	On Friday morning, before the market's sell-off, the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted 2% annual rate, through next year, then accelerate anew in 1991.
22345018	Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast, only two projected periods of decline in the nation's output over the next two years, and in "both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession," said Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council.
22346001	The real estate slump that's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city's retail real estate market.
22346002	In Manhattan, once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill.
22346003	Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy, turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom.
22346004	"There is an unbelievable amount of space available," says Faith Consolo, senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc.
22346005	There are about 2,000 stores for rent, up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500.
22346006	"This further confuses retailers," she says.
22346007	"They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down?
22346008	Is this the wrong time to open a store?
22346009	Who is going to be in the space next door?"
22346010	In addition, Ms. Consolo says, tenants usually can negotiate to pay rents that are about one-quarter lower than landlords' initial asking price.
22346011	A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents.
22346012	And, in some neighborhoods, rents have merely hit a plateau.
22346013	But on average, Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10% to 15% in the past six months alone, experts say.
22346014	That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months, after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986.
22346015	The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing.
22346016	"As businesses contract or depart, the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks," says Edward A. Friedman, senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc.
22346017	He says financial problems plaguing electronics, fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market.
22346018	Hardest hit are what he calls "secondary" sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents.
22346019	In these locations, Mr. Friedman says, "Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined."
22346020	Weakness in the restaurant industry, which is leaving retail space vacant, exacerbates the problem for landlords.
22346021	It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores, which anchor retail neighborhoods, are in doubt.
22346022	Hooker Corp., parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's, is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale's is for sale by its owner, Campeau Corp.
22346023	The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.
22346024	But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed.
22346025	Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean Manhattan comes cheap.
22346026	New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities.
22346027	Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $500 a square foot, and $250 is not uncommon.
22346028	The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $100 a square foot, as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue.
22346029	By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 a square foot.
22346030	And rents on Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive generally don't exceed about $125 a square foot.
22346031	The New York Stock Exchange said two securities will begin trading this week.

22346038	It had traded over-the-counter.

22347001	When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure.
22347002	For the first time, the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
22347003	This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.
22347004	But are these four players, three of them in their 80s, ready to assume a different role after 88 years, collectively, of service on the high court?
22347005	Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role, and the frustrations that go with it, but in different ways.
22347006	Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad.
22347007	The four justices are no newcomers to dissent, often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court's conservative drift.
22347008	But always, in years past, they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases.
22347009	Now, however, as the court's new five-member conservative majority continues to solidify, victories for the liberals are rare.
22347010	The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.
22347011	In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.
22347012	Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions, with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory.
22347013	But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech.
22347014	"Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result," he said.
22347015	Moreover, in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s, he knew that the tables might turn in the future.
22347016	He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt, a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court's opinions.
22347017	Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was "depressed" about the court's direction last spring, but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights.
22347018	"We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going to do it," he said in a speech last month.
22347019	He, like Justice Brennan, considers dissents highly important for the future, a point that hasn't escaped legal scholars.
22347020	Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents.
22347021	The dissenters in the Warren Court, he says, appeared to be writing for the short-term, suggesting that the court's direction might change soon.
22347022	"Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future," he says.
22347023	Justice Blackmun, who will turn 81 next month, also seems feisty about his new role.
22347024	Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues, especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion, Roe vs. Wade.
22347025	Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years.
22347026	And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August.
22347027	But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago.
22347028	He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the 1963 March on Washington.
22347029	Justice Stevens, 69, is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role, in part because he may be the least liberal of the four, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others.
22347030	If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history, it also differs in an important way from recent history, court watchers say.
22347031	"The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited," says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, "but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created.
22348001	The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions, in its first wave of sales of big, sick thrifts, but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth.
22348002	The four S&Ls were sold to large banks, as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago.
22348003	Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., which has aggressively expanded its markets, particularly in Texas and Florida.
22348004	A Canadian bank bought another thrift, in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank.
22348005	Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets.
22348006	These "clean-bank" transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government, to be sold later.
22348007	In these four, for instance, the RTC is stuck with $4.51 billion in bad assets.
22348008	Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5% to 3.7% for the deposits and branch systems, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting.
22348009	The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks, as has been the case with previous deals.
22348010	After that, the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts.
22348011	But it's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps.
22348012	NCNB, for example, has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market, and in Florida, rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities.
22348013	The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines, but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency.
22348014	"These thrifts are beached whales," said Bert Ely, an industry consultant based in Alexandria, Va.
22348015	For example, the delay in selling People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with $1.7 billion in assets, has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch, instead of as a whole institution.
22348016	NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets.
22348017	NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston, which had assets of $2.8 billion.
22348018	NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $129 million for $3.5 billion in deposits.
22348019	As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk, the RTC will pay $3.8 billion to NCNB to take $750 million of bad assets.
22348020	NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., which had total assets of $900 million.
22348021	NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $40.4 million for $1.1 billion in deposits.
22348022	NCNB will also acquire $266 million of Freedom's assets from the RTC, which will require $875 million in assistance.
22348023	Meridian Bancorp Inc., Reading, Pa., will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa., which had $2.3 billion in assets.
22348024	Meridian will pay a premium of $30.5 million to assume $2 billion in deposits.
22348025	It will also purchase $845 million of the thrift's assets, with $1.9 billion in RTC assistance.
22348026	In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer, Royal Trustco Ltd., Toronto, will acquire Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif., which had $949 million in assets.
22348027	Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $25 million to assume $989 million in deposits.
22348028	It will also purchase $473 million in assets, and receive $550 million in assistance from the RTC.
22349001	The following issues were recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission:

22350001	Time magazine, in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers, is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways.
22350002	In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc.'s weekly magazine said Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 to $55.
22350003	In a related development, the news-weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990; a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000.
22350004	However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber, according to Richard Heinemann, Time associate publisher.
22350005	Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers.
22350006	In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co.'s McCall's, and most recently News Corp.'s TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers.
22350007	Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies.
22350008	But Time, as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner, wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks.
22350009	Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky.
22350010	"Giveaways just give people the wrong image," said Mr. Heinemann.
22350011	"That perception takes the focus off the magazine."
22350012	Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers.
22350013	"What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said Mr. Heinemann.
22350014	"We are trying to create quality and involvement."
22350015	However, Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million.
22350016	And Time's paid circulation, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations, dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30, 1989.
22350017	Still, Time's move is being received well, once again.
22350018	"It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more," said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency.
22350019	"A few drops in circulation are of no consequence.
22350020	It's not a show of weakness; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits."
22350021	Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away.
22350022	"The question is how much are we getting from each reader," said Mr. Heinemann.
22350023	Time's rivals news-weeklies, Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, are less reliant on electronic giveaways, and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases.
22350024	Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month.
22351001	When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago, Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing.
22351002	"They said, `follow CNN,'" he told reporters.
22351003	That shows how far Ted Turner's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago, when it was considered the laughingstock of television news.
22351004	It is bigger, faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks.
22351005	Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world.
22351006	But for all its success, CNN has hit a plateau.
22351007	Although viewership soars when big news breaks, it ebbs during periods of calm.
22351008	CNN executives worry that the network's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and won't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV.
22351009	"Just the fact we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin," says Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president, news gathering (and no relation to Ted Turner).
22351010	"You can't live on that."
22351011	So CNN, a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel, or what people in the television industry call a "top of mind" network.
22351012	Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts.
22351013	The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier, a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism.
22351014	The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length "signature" programming with recognizable stars.
22351015	To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program.
22351016	It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers.
22351017	And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team.
22351018	"The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables," says Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News, CNN's sister network.
22351019	But that won't be easy.
22351020	Networks, like other consumer products, develop images in peoples' minds that aren't easy to change.
22351021	It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see.
22351022	And the cable-TV operators -- CNN's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are.
22351023	The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive.
22351024	Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co.'s Consumer News and Business Channel, both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future.
22351025	In addition, many cable-TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations.
22351026	CNN wants to change its viewers' habits.
22351027	Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research.
22351028	That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks.
22351029	The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels.
22351030	CNN's viewer habits have been molded by its format.
22351031	Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service.
22351032	It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks.
22351033	It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called "Daybreak," "Daywatch," "Newsday," and "Newsnight," but the shows varied little in content, personality or look.
22351034	Now, the push is on for more-distinctive shows.
22351035	"Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity," says Paul Amos, CNN executive vice president for programming.
22351036	Accordingly, CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most "differentiated" programs in viewers' minds, says Mr. Amos.
22351037	And it is exploring other original programs, similar to its "Larry King Live" and "Crossfire" talk shows, which executives hope will keep people tuned in.
22351038	Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier.
22351039	Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period.
22351040	But 70% of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in.
22351041	Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.
22351042	Some in the industry are skeptical.
22351043	"I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says Reuven Frank, the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report.
22351044	The evening news is also slated as CNN's stage for its big push into investigative journalism.
22351045	In August, the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC.
22351046	She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly, in-depth segments, with an eye toward breaking big stories.
22351047	CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way "60 Minutes" did so well for CBS.
22351048	That's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces.
22351049	"They've never shown any inclination to spend money on production," says Michael Mosettig, a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job.
22351050	The network's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards, resulting in a less-experienced work force.
22351051	CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15%, but they're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks.
22351052	Says Mr. Mosettig: "CNN is my wire service; they're on top of everything.
22351053	But to improve, they've really got to make the investment in people."
22351054	In any case, cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN's format.
22351055	They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage.
22351056	"We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest, long-format programming," says Robert Stengel, senior vice president, programming, of Continental Cablevision Inc., which holds a 2% stake in Turner Broadcasting.
22352001	The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position Pennzoil Co. took in its dispute with Texaco, contrary to your Sept. 8 article "Court Backs Texaco's View in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late."
22352002	The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound.
22352003	In the Pennzoil/Texaco litigation, the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound.
22352004	Admittedly, the principle in the cases is the same.
22352005	But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts.
22352006	And the facts, as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits, were different.
22352007	When you suggest otherwise, you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation.

22353001	Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application to buy five Valley Federal branches, leaving the transaction in limbo.
22353002	The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp., whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial's thrift unit failed to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements.
22353003	The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received.
22353004	The transaction, announced in August, included about $146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California's San Joaquin Valley.
22353005	Terms weren't disclosed, but Valley Federal had said it expected to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $2 million in operating costs annually.
22353006	Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp., which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements.
22353007	Valley Federal, with assets of $3.3 billion, is based in Van Nuys.
22353008	Imperial Corp., based in San Diego, is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan.
22353009	In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $33.1 million.
22354001	Call it the "we're too broke to fight" defense.
22354002	Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors.
22354003	The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments.
22354004	Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it, even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position.
22354005	Still, one federal appeals court has signaled it's willing to entertain the notion, and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law.
22354006	The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills, which topped $73 million last year.
22354007	The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
22354008	Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.
22354009	Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals "that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party, including FSLIC."
22354010	"If true," the court wrote, "this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."
22354011	But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.
22354012	Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits, because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988.
22354013	"This institution is just brain dead," says Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm.
22354014	But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour."
22354015	Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.
22354016	"We're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory," he says.
22354017	"We'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize.
22355001	Kenneth J. Thygerson, who was named president of this thrift holding company in August, resigned, citing personal reasons.
22355002	Mr. Thygerson said he had planned to travel between the job in Denver and his San Diego home, but has found the commute too difficult to continue.
22355003	A new president wasn't named.
22356001	SOUTH AFRICA FREED the ANC's Sisulu and seven other political prisoners.
22356002	Thousands of supporters, many brandishing flags of the outlawed African National Congress, gave the anti-apartheid activists a tumultuous reception upon their return to black townships across the country.
22356003	Most of those freed had spent at least 25 years in prison.
22356004	The 77-year-old Sisulu, sentenced to life in 1964 along with black nationalist Nelson Mandela for plotting to overthrow the government, said equality for blacks in South Africa was in reach.
22356005	The releases, announced last week by President de Klerk, were viewed as Pretoria's tacit legalization of the ANC.
22356006	Mandela, considered the most prominent leader of the ANC, remains in prison.
22356007	But his release within the next few months is widely expected.
22356008	The Soviet Union reported that thousands of tons of goods needed to ease widespread shortages across the nation were piled up at ports and rail depots, and food shipments were rotting because of a lack of people and equipment to move the cargo.
22356009	Strikes and mismanagement were cited, and Premier Ryzhkov warned of "tough measures."
22356010	Bush indicated there might be "room for flexibility" in a bill to allow federal funding of abortions for poor women who are vicitims of rape and incest.
22356011	He reiterated his opposition to such funding, but expressed hope of a compromise.
22356012	The president, at a news conference Friday, also renewed a call for the ouster of Panama's Noriega.
22356013	The White House said minors haven't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents.
22356014	The administration's policy was stated in a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions.
22356015	Ten of the nation's governors, meanwhile, called on the justices to reject efforts to limit abortions.
22356016	The Justice Department announced that the FBI has been given the authority to seize U.S. fugitives overseas without the permission of foreign governments.
22356017	Secretary of State Baker emphasized Friday that the new policy wouldn't be invoked by the Bush administration without full consideration of foreign-policy implications.

22356021	South Korea's President Roh traveled to the U.S. for a five-day visit that is expected to focus on ties between Washington and Seoul.
22356022	Roh, who is facing calls for the reduction of U.S. military forces in South Korea, is to meet with Bush tomorrow and is to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday.
22356023	China's Communist leadership voted to purge the party of "hostile and anti-party elements" and wealthy private businessmen, whom they called exploiters.
22356024	The decision, reported by the official Xinhua News Agency, indicated that the crackdown prompted by student-led pro-democracy protests in June is intensifying.

22356028	Zaire's President Mobutu met in southern France with Angolan rebel leader Savimbi and a senior U.S. envoy in a bid to revive an accord to end Angola's civil war.
22356029	Details of the talks, described by a Zairean official as "very delicate," weren't disclosed.
22356030	PLO leader Arafat insisted on guarantees that any elections in the Israeli-occupied territories would be impartial.
22356031	He made his remarks to a PLO gathering in Baghdad.
22356032	In the occupied lands, underground leaders of the Arab uprising rejected a U.S. plan to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks as Shamir opposed holding such discussions in Cairo.
22356033	Lebanese Christian lawmakers presented to Arab mediators at talks in Saudi Arabia proposals for a new timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's forces from Lebanon.

22357001	A group of Arby's franchisees said they formed an association to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's control of the restaurant chain.
22357002	The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that began in August.
22357003	At the time, a group called R.B. Partners Ltd., consisting of eight of Arby's largest franchisees, offered more than $200 million to buy Arby's Inc., which is part of DWG Corp.
22357004	DWG is a holding company controlled by Mr. Posner.
22357005	One week later, Leonard H. Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Arby's, was fired in a dispute with Mr. Posner.
22357006	Friday, 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to "preserve the integrity of the Arby's system."
22357007	The franchisees, owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby's in the U.S., said: "We have concluded that continued control of Arby's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us, because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby's system.
22357008	We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby's Inc. and the Arby's system."
22357009	The group said it would consider, among other things, withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings.
22357010	In Florida, Renee Mottram, a senior vice president at DWG, responded: "We don't think any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self-serving motives.
22358001	September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
22358002	After falling for three consecutive months, the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9% last month, the Labor Department reported Friday, as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer.
22358003	Although the report, which was released before the stock market opened, didn't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, analysts said it did play a role in the market's decline.
22358004	Analysts immediately viewed the price data, the grimmest inflation news in months, as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped.
22358005	Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit, the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5% in September, to $145.21 billion.
22358006	That rise came on top of a 0.7% gain in August, and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy.
22358007	"I think the Friday report, combined with the actions of the Fed, weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
22358008	But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers.
22358009	"The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%," said Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
22358010	But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump.
22358011	"I would say this is not bad news; this is a blip," he said.
22358012	"The core rate is not really out of line."
22358013	All year, energy prices have skewed the producer price index, which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods.
22358014	Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter, when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates.
22358015	Energy prices then plummeted through the summer, causing the index to decline for three consecutive months.
22358016	Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year, the Labor Department said.
22358017	While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year, that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0% increase for all of 1988.
22358018	Moreover, this year's good inflation news may have ended last month, when energy prices zoomed up 6.5% after plunging 7.3% in August.
22358019	Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead, leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain.
22358020	Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index, but the 0.9% climb was higher than most anticipated.
22358021	"I think the resurgence {in inflation} is going to continue for a few months," said John Mueller, chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon, a Washington economic forecasting firm.
22358022	He predicted that inflation will moderate next year, saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide.
22358023	But Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said that last month's rise "isn't as bad an omen" as the 0.9% figure suggests.
22358024	"If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods," he explained.
22358025	Passenger car prices jumped 3.8% in September, after climbing 0.5% in August and declining in the late spring and summer.
22358026	Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event, coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models.
22358027	Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations, car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase.
22358028	Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1% in September, while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1%.
22358029	Food prices declined 0.6%, after climbing 0.3% in August.
22358030	Meanwhile, the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8% in September to $32.82 billion.
22358031	But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices, analysts said.
22358032	Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7% after declining 0.6% in August, while sales of building materials fell 1.8% after rising 1.7%.
22358033	Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4% in September, after dropping for three consecutive months.
22358034	Prices for crude goods, an array of raw materials, jumped 1.1% after declining 1.9% in August and edging up 0.2% in July.
22358035	Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes (1982=100) for September, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from September, 1988.
22359001	CityFed Financial Corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $125 million to $150 million for the third quarter.
22359002	In the year-earlier period, CityFed had net income of $485,000, but no per-share earnings.
22359003	CityFed's president and chief executive officer, John Atherton, said the loss stems from several factors.
22359004	He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $700 million from $516 million between June and September.
22359005	Approximately 85% of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets.
22359006	Accordingly, CityFed estimated that it will provide between $85 million and $110 million for credit losses in the third quarter.
22359007	CityFed added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank, CityFed's primary subsidiary, based in Somerset, N.J.
22359008	City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida.
22359009	Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds.
22359010	That action, CityFed said, will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $30 million.
22359011	CityFed also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan origination operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and, as a result, is taking a charge for discontinued operations.
22359012	All these actions, Mr. Atherton said, will result in a loss of $125 million to $150 million for the third quarter.
22359013	He added, however: "Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves, the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range.
22360001	CenTrust Savings Bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock, indicating that regulators' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened.
22360002	In a statement, Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift's operating losses and "apparent losses" in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends.
22360003	Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock.
22360004	David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which issued the directive, saying it was "inappropriate" and based on "insufficient" reasons.
22360005	He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision.
22360006	The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution's health.
22360007	In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a "troubled institution," largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses.
22360008	In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track.
22360009	For the nine months ended June 30, CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.
22360010	CenTrust, which is Florida's largest thrift, holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation.
22360011	Since April, it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $890 million from $1.35 billion.
22360012	Mr. Paul said only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
22360013	The remainder, he said, are commercial loan participations, or private placements, that aren't filed with the SEC and don't have a ready market.
22360014	CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds.
22360015	The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but CenTrust has said it can't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market.
22360016	Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust's and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market.
22360017	The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new, somber regulatory climate.
22360018	In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, CenTrust common shares closed at $3, down 12.5 cents.
22360019	In a statement Friday, Mr. Paul challenged the regulators' decision, saying the thrift's operating losses and "apparent" junk-bond losses "have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank."
22360020	He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds.
22360021	In the third quarter, for instance, CenTrust added $22.5 million to its general reserves.
22360022	Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
22360023	The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to Mr. Paul.
22360024	Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction, which was announced in July, long before now.
22360025	Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal.
22360026	Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution.
22360027	CenTrust, however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.
22360028	It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards.
22360029	CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company's large amount of good will by about $180 million.
22360030	Critics, however, say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds.
22360031	Mr. Paul counters that he intends to further pare the size of CenTrust by not renewing more than $1 billion of brokered certificates of deposit when they come due.
22360032	The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds, and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate, as required under the new thrift law.
22361001	On a recent Saturday night, in the midst of West Germany's most popular prime-time show, a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble, while blindfolded.
22361002	The woman won the bet.
22361003	But perhaps even more remarkable, the three-hour-show, "Wetten Dass" (Make a Bet), regularly wins the top slot in the country's TV ratings, sometimes drawing as many as 50% of West German households.
22361004	As the 1992 economic integration approaches, Europe's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American "cultural imperialism," threatening to impose quotas against such pop invaders as "Dallas," "Miami Vice" and "L.A. Law."
22361005	But much of what the Europeans want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out.
22361006	The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers, who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60% of Europe's TV shows be produced in Europe.
22361007	So far, the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail.
22361008	A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why.
22361009	While there are some popular action and drama series, few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect.
22361010	More European air time is filled with low-budget game shows, variety hours, movies and talk shows, many of which are authorized knock-offs of their American counterparts.
22361011	One of France's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions.
22361012	A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian.
22361013	One of Italy's favorite shows, "Fantastico," a tepid variety show, is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product, "Cacao Fantastico," whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product didn't exist.
22361014	Topping the cheese stunt, on another typical evening of fun on "Wetten Dass," a contestant won a bet with the show's host, Thomas Gottschalk, that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone.
22361015	A celebrity guest, U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt, also won a bet that someone could pile up $150 worth of quarters on a slanted coin.
22361016	Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost, agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes.
22361017	If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers, it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get.
22361018	European programs usually target only their own local audience, and often only a small portion of that.
22361019	Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain, and almost never show up on U.S. screens.
22361020	Attempts to produce "pan-European" programs have generally resulted in disappointment.
22361021	One annual co-production, the three-hour-long "Eurovision Song Contest," featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries, has been described as the world's most boring TV show.
22361022	Another, "Jeux Sans Frontieres," where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks, is a hit in France.
22361023	A U.S.-made imitation under the title "Almost Anything Goes" flopped fast.
22361024	For the most part, what's made here stays here, and for good reason.
22361025	The cream of the British crop, the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as "Masterpiece Theater," make up a relatively small part of British air time.
22361026	Most British programming is more of an acquired taste.
22361027	There is, for instance, "One Man and His Dog," a herding contest among sheep dogs.
22361028	Also riveting to the British are hours of dart-throwing championships, even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons.
22361029	European drama has had better, though still mixed, fortunes.
22361030	The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns.
22361031	A French knock-off of "Dallas," called "Chateauvallon" and set in a French vineyard, had a good run in France, which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident.
22361032	"Schwarzwaldklinik," (Black Forest Clinic), a kind of German "St. Elsewhere" set in a health spa, is popular in Germany, and has spread into France.
22361033	Italy's most popular series is a drama called "La Piovra," or "The Octopus," which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia.
22361034	It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series.
22361035	Spain's most popular mini-series this year was "Juncal," the story of an aging bullfighter.
22361036	"The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular, with American programs second," says Brian Wenham, a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corp.
22361037	"Given a choice, everybody will watch a home-produced show."
22361038	But frequently there isn't much choice.
22361039	Thus, Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own, programs with broader appeal.
22361040	"We've basically got to start from scratch, to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see," concedes Colin Young, head of Britain's National Film Theatre School.
22361041	While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is to blame for the European TV industry's sluggish development.
22361042	Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising.
22361043	Since production costs were guaranteed, it didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold abroad or put into syndication, as most American programs are.
22361044	But not much money was spent on the shows, either, a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows, while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas.
22361045	Now, however, commercial channels are coming to most European countries, and at the same time, satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly.
22361046	Just last week, Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels.
22361047	The result is a new and huge appetite for programming.
22361049	Sky Channel, a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch, offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience.
22361050	The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss's other ventures.
22361051	In a Madrid hotel room recently, a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, only to be urged by the British announcer to "stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo."
22361052	Lisa Grishaw-Mueller in Bonn, Laura Colby in Milan, Tim Carrington in London and Carlta Vitzhum in Madrid contributed to this article.
22362001	British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions, greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.
22362002	The 50-50 joint venture, which may be dubbed Eurodynamics, would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion ($2.17 billion) and would be among the world's largest missile makers.
22362003	After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.
22362004	The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end.
22362005	The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.
22362006	In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture.
22362007	Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system.
22362008	Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.
22362009	The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.
22362010	Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.
22362011	But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford, Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces.
22362012	Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF.
22362013	Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and France's Dassault group.
22362014	But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid, the source indicated.
22362015	GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said included #215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged last year.
22362016	Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.
22362017	A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials.
22362018	A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti: "Competition is the name of the game," she said.
22362019	At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists it isn't interested in Ferranti.
22362020	"We have nothing to say about this affair, which doesn't concern us," a Matra official said Sunday.
22362021	The missile venture, the British Aerospace spokeswoman said, is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting.
22362022	For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices.
22362023	The venture's importance for Thomson is great.
22362024	Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans.
22362025	The European defense industry is consolidating; for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co., and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.H.
22362026	In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.; to better compete, Thomson officials say, they need a partnership.
22362027	To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.
22362028	Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million, a Thomson spokesman said.
22362029	British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17-year-old family of Rapier surface-to-air missiles.
22362030	Thomson missile products, with about half British Aerospace's annual revenue, include the Crotale surface-to-air missile family.
22363001	Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said it will delay a proposed two-step, 830 million Canadian-dollar (US$705.6 million) expansion of its system because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking.
22363002	Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
22363003	Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level.
22363004	"The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.
22363005	Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.
22363006	"There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side," he said.
22363007	Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
22363008	The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration," said Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.
22363009	Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.
22363010	Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.
22363011	Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.
22363012	Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
22363013	That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.
22363014	Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East.
22363015	"It's very much a growing concern.
22363016	But when something is inevitable, you learn to live with it," he said.
22363017	Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.
22363018	Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion, which would have required regulatory approval, Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system, beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.
22363019	The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day.
22364001	Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50% from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs.
22364002	In the second quarter, the steelmaker had net income of $45.3 million or $1.25 a share, including a pretax charge of $17 million related to the settlement of a suit, on sales of $1.11 billion.
22364003	The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter, compared with the second quarter.
22364004	At the same time, the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses, as well as higher labor costs under its new contract.
22364005	The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit.
22364006	The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments, which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter.
22364007	Inland said its third-quarter results will be announced later this week.
22364008	In the year-earlier third quarter, when the industry was in the midst of a boom, the company had net of $61 million, or $1.70 a share, on sales of $1.02 billion.
22365001	Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately.
22365002	Take Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether.
22365003	In July, the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10% in 1990, a modest increase when compared with the sizzling expansion of years past.
22365004	Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company's stock, which lost $3.25 that day to close at $52 in national over-the-counter trading.
22365005	But that was all of three months ago.
22365006	Last week, Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34%.
22365007	The announcement caused the company's stock to surge $6.50 to close at $75.50 a share.
22365008	Microsoft's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms.
22365009	"It's hard to know what to expect at this point," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co.
22365010	"The industry defies characterization."
22365011	To illustrate, Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows, half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year's results, and half above those results.
22365012	Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co., Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., generally solid performers in the past.
22365013	International Business Machines Corp. also is expected to report disappointing results.
22365014	Apple Computer Inc., meanwhile, is expected to show improved earnings for the period ended Sept.
22365015	Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc., a computer retailer.
22365016	In July, the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $7.4 million, or 23 cents a share.
22365017	This month, however, Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 hadn't met expectations.
22365018	The company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share, down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period.
22365019	While the earnings picture confuses, observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer.
22365020	Companies will continue to war over standards.
22365021	In computer publishing, a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc., which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays.
22365022	Until recently, Adobe had a lock on the market for image software, but last month Apple, Adobe's biggest customer, and Microsoft rebelled.
22365023	Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe's approach, and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM, the biggest seller of personal computers, along with them.
22365024	The short-term outlook for Adobe's business, however, appears strong.
22365025	The company is beginning to ship a new software program that's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple.
22365026	The program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material.
22365027	John Warnock, Adobe's chief executive officer, said the Mountain View, Calif., company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago.
22365028	Meanwhile, competition between various operating systems, which control the basic functions of a computer, spells trouble for software firms generally.
22365029	"It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales," said Russ Crabs, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group.
22365030	Mr. Crabs said this probably is behind the expected weak performance of Aldus Corp., maker of a widely used computer publishing program.
22365031	He expects Aldus to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $19.5 million for its third quarter, compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of 20.4 million in the year-earlier period.
22365032	Aldus officials couldn't be reached for comment.
22365033	On the other hand, the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant.
22365034	A bus is the data highway within a computer.
22365035	IBM is backing one type of bus called microchannel, while the nine other leading computer makers, including H-P and Compaq Computer Corp., have chosen another method.
22365036	"Users don't care about the bus," said Daniel Benton, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
22365037	He said Apple's family of Macintosh computers, for instance, uses four different buses "and no one seems to mind."
22365038	The gap between winners and laggards will grow.
22365039	In personal computers, Apple, Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business.
22365040	At the same time, second-tier firms will continue to lose ground.
22365041	Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether.
22365042	Wyse Technology, for instance, is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation.
22365043	"Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business, but they haven't delivered products that sell," said Kimball Brown, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
22365044	Mr. Brown estimates Wyse, whose terminals business is strong, will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended Sept.
22365045	Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms.
22365046	Ever-more powerful desk-top computers, designed with one or more microprocessors as their "brains," are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes.
22365047	"The guys that make traditional hardware are really being obsoleted by microprocessor-based machines," said Mr. Benton.
22365048	As a result of this trend, longtime powerhouses H-P, IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own.
22365049	But they will have to act quickly.
22365050	Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines.
22365051	A raft of new computer companies also has targeted this "server" market.
22366001	Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States
22366002	IOWA IS MAKING a comeback.
22366003	So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.
22366004	The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s.
22366005	The gains, to be sure, are rather small.
22366006	Iowa, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988, the Census Bureau says.
22366007	Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that hadn't grown at all since 1981.
22366008	Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people.
22366009	Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
22366010	The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race.
22366011	Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980, including New York, which lost 4% of its population during the 1970s.
22366012	And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again.
22366013	At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround.
22366014	Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska.
22366015	Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest, and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue.
22366016	But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing.
22366017	More Elderly Maintain Their Independence
22366018	THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together.
22366019	And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent.
22366020	A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970.
22366021	This doesn't mean they're less likely to live alone, however.
22366022	That share has remained at about 24% since 1970.
22366023	What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children.
22366024	In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970.
22366025	As people get even older, many become widowed.
22366026	But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to 40% in 1988 from 38% in 1970.
22366027	Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives.
22366028	Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970.
22366029	The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%.
22366030	More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially.
22366031	Careers Count Most For the Well-to-Do
22366032	MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family.
22366033	At least that's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich, Clancy, Shulman indicates.
22366034	Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families.
22366035	Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group.
22366036	Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich.
22366037	Average household income for the sample was $194,000, and average net assets were reported as $775,000.
22366038	The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class.
22366039	Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income.
22366040	Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like rather than just what they need, and appreciate products that are distinctive.
22366041	Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it.
22366042	Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off.
22366043	Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either.
22366044	About 40% don't feel they're more able than others.
22366045	While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent, only 25% give $2,500 or more to charity each year.
22366046	Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, 60% feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one's principles.
22366047	Odds and Ends
22366048	THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978.
22366049	The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47% of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from 33% in 1978.
22366050	The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16% from 12%. . . .
22366051	Per-capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
22366052	The amount of income divvied up for each man, woman and child was $16,489 in 1988, up 6.6% from $15,472 in 1987.
22366053	Per capita personal income ranged from $11,116 in Mississippi to $23,059 in Connecticut. . . .
22366054	There are 13.1 million students in college this fall, up 2% from 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates.
22366055	About 54% are women, and 44% are part-time students.
22367001	This small Dallas suburb's got trouble.
22367002	Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool.
22367003	More than 30 years ago, Prof. Harold Hill, the con man in Meredith Willson's "The Music Man," warned the citizens of River City, Iowa, against the game.
22367004	Now kindred spirits on Addison's town council have barred the town's fanciest hotel, the Grand Kempinski, from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge.
22367005	Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison's main street.
22367006	And the mayor, in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill's, warned that "alcohol leads to betting, which leads to fights."
22367007	The council's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years.
22367008	"Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on," says Tom Manske, vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association.
22367009	Pool is hot in New York and Chicago, he insists, where "upscale, suit-and-tie places" are adding tables.
22367010	With today's tougher drunk driving laws, he adds, "people don't want to just sit around and drink."
22367011	Besides, rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski, where rooms average $200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $3.50 a pop.
22367012	At the lounge, manager Elizabeth Dyer won't admit patrons in jeans, T-shirts or tennis shoes.
22367013	But a majority of the Addison council didn't buy those arguments.
22367014	Introducing pool, argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker, would be "dangerous.
22367015	It would open a can of worms."
22367016	Addison is no stranger to cans of worms, either.
22367017	After its previous mayor committed suicide last year, an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects, gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town's coffers for trips and retreats.
22367018	The revelations embarrassed town officials, although they argued that the problems weren't as severe as the media suggested.
22367019	Now comes the pool flap.
22367020	"I think there's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous," Councilman John Nolan says.
22367021	"I thought this was all taken care of in `The Music Man.
22368001	The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS's new show "Island Son" (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 25) was the local color; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework.
22368002	For instance: "Haole" (white) is not the ultimate insult; "Mainland haole" is.
22368003	Richard Chamberlain dresses as a "Mainland haole," tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves.
22368004	And the local expression for brother is "brah," not "bruddah."
22368005	And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty, if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left, not right, ear.
22368006	Sorry, the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color.
22368007	Anita Davis
22369001	Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which is the most troublesome right now?
22369002	A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City.
22369003	Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT).
22369004	Not only is Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup," he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup," and he's currently a man in hot water.
22369005	Here, in neutral language, is the gist of Mr. Mason's remarks, quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign, and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company.
22369006	Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically.
22369007	He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically.
22369008	He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa.
22369009	Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language.
22369010	As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular.
22369011	He said Jews were "sick with complexes"; and he called David Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani's black opponent, "a fancy shvartze with a mustache."
22369012	If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot?
22369013	It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.
22369014	In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.
22369015	For example, the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur.
22369016	People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck."
22369017	These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group, such as "Polish jokes"; and the type that is double-edged, aiming inward as well as outward.
22369018	The latter typically is the humor of the underdog, and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves.
22369019	In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.
22369020	But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.
22369021	Why constructive?
22369022	Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.
22369023	That's why it's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police, on college campuses and elsewhere, taboo all critical mention of group differences.
22369024	As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook, "Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer."
22369025	The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam?
22369026	Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy.
22369027	It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show."
22369028	But these are not the differences that make headlines.
22369029	In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (Lynn Redgrave), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (Rita Karin) and her brother Michael (Brandon Maggart).
22369030	It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants.
22369031	At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie.
22369032	It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup" is being made from an old recipe.
22369033	And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.
22369034	Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of "Abie's Irish Rose" made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author, Anne Nichols, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.
22369035	And it has remained there, as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called "Bridget Loves Bernie," whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney.
22369036	Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all.
22369037	So far, the bubbles have been few and far between.
22369038	Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms, ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear, to preach about social issues.
22369039	To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them.
22369040	For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.
22369041	Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona.
22369042	The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself.
22369043	But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade-ethnic differences.
22369044	I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.
22369045	That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer.
22369046	But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.
22369047	At your age, Jackie, you ought to know that you can't make soup without turning up the flame.
22370001	The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60-year history of calm, right up through Friday.
22370002	Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline "doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy."
22370003	"The economy," he added, "remains well-balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth."
22370004	Sound familiar?
22370005	Here's what Ronald Reagan said after the 1987 crash: "The underlying economy remains sound.
22370006	There is nothing wrong with the economy . . . all the indices are up."
22370007	Heard that before?
22370008	After the 1929 crash, Herbert Hoover said: "The fundamental business of the country . . . is on a sound and prosperous basis.
22371001	James Robinson, 57 years old, was elected president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives.
22371002	He has been president and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp., a division of North American Philips Corp., itself a subsidiary of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands.
22371003	Charles J. Lawson Jr., 68, who had been acting chief executive since June 14, will continue as chairman.
22371004	The former president and chief executive, Eric W. Markrud, resigned in June.
22372001	The Senate's decision to approve a bare-bones deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year.
22372002	Late Friday night, the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened, rather than narrowed, the federal budget deficit.
22372003	Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases.
22372004	"We're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.).
22372005	But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside, including a capital-gains tax cut.
22372006	In addition, the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision.
22372007	House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while.
22372008	"No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side," said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.).
22372009	But, he added, "I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year."
22372010	White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration wouldn't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill.
22372011	"We don't need this as a way to get capital gains," he said.
22372012	House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) said in an interview, "If that's the signal that comes from the White House, that will help a great deal."
22372013	The Senate's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year.
22372014	Opponents of the cut are playing hardball.
22372015	Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said he was "confident" that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation wouldn't include a capital-gains tax cut.
22372016	And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax legislation originates, said there aren't any "plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year."
22372017	One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut, and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill, is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit.
22372018	Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month.
22372019	The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress.
22372020	Because the legislation hasn't been completed, President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
22372021	Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill.
22372022	The House appears reluctant to join the senators.
22372023	A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues' decision to drop many pet provisions.
22372024	"Although I am encouraged by the Senate action," said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee, "it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate."
22372025	Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks.
22372026	He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut.
22372027	But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor, so they went ahead with the streamlined bill.
22372028	The Senate bill was stripped of many popular, though revenue-losing, provisions, a number of which are included in the House-passed bill.
22372029	These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures.
22372030	Also missing from the Senate bill is the House's repeal of a law, called Section 89, that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives.
22372031	One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
22372032	Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon.
22372033	To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare.
22372034	To the detriment of many low-income people, efforts to boost Medicaid funding, especially in rural areas, also were stricken.
22372035	Asked why senators were giving up so much, New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said, "We're looking like idiots.
22372036	Things had just gone too far."
22372037	Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator.
22372038	It worked, others said, because there were no exceptions: all revenue-losing provisions were stricken.
22372039	The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced.
22372040	In addition, the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3% excise tax on long-distance telephone calls.
22372041	It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting, which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden.
22372042	It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees.
22372043	Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties, which would have raised $65 million in fiscal 1990.
22372044	A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised.
22372045	The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell, who had proposed the streamlining.
22372046	Mr. Mitchell's relations with Budget Director Darman, who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure, have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill.
22372047	The deficit reduction bill contains $5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990, and $26 billion over five years.
22372048	The revenue-raising provisions, which affect mostly corporations, would:
22372049	-- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs, effective Aug. 2, 1989.
22372050	-- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received, effective the day after the tax bill is enacted.
22372051	-- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans, effective June 6, 1989, that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers.
22372052	The measure repeals a 50% exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP, if the ESOP owns less than 30% of the employer's stock.
22372053	-- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities, such as zero-coupon bonds, that postpone cash interest payments.
22372054	-- Raise $851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes.
22372055	-- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies, effective August 1990.
22372056	-- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals, such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam, beginning at $1.10 a pound starting next year.
22372057	-- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding.
22372058	-- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly, effective next year.
22372059	-- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash.
22372060	-- Increase to $6 a person from $3 the international air-passenger departure tax, and impose a $3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships.
22372061	The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees.
22372062	Among its provisions:
22372063	-- Reduction of Medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $2.8 billion, in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians.
22372064	The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year.
22372065	-- Removal of the U.S. Postal Service's operating budget from the federal budget, reducing the deficit by $1.77 billion.
22372066	A similar provision is in the House version.
22372067	-- Authority for the Federal Aviation Administration to raise $239 million by charging fees for commercial airline-landing rights at New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and National Airport in Washington.
22372068	-- Increases in Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees totaling $54 million.
22372069	-- Direction to the U.S. Coast Guard to collect $50 million from users of Coast Guard services.
22372070	-- Raising an additional $43 million by increasing existing Federal Communications Commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for amateur radio operators, ship stations and mobile radio facilities.

22373001	In response to your overly optimistic, outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts (People Patterns, Sept. 20): I am in the communications field, above entry level.
22373002	I was laid off in August 1988, and after a thorough and exhausting job search, was hired in August 1989.
22373003	My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a job; I found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies.
22373004	The statistics quoted by the "new" Census Bureau report (garnered from 1984 to 1986) are out of date, certainly as an average for the Northeast, and possibly for the rest of the country.
22373005	I think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well -- if you're getting laid off don't worry, and if you're unemployed, it's a seller's market.
22373006	To top it off, you captioned the graph showing the average number of months in a job search as "Time Off."

22375001	Moody's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on $165 million of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift, citing turmoil in the market for low-grade, high-yield securities.
22375002	The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade.
22375003	Columbia Savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds.
22375004	New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years.

22375006	FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION (Ottawa, Kan.) --
22375007	Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $20 million of this thrift's senior subordinated notes.
22375008	The rating concern said Franklin's "troubled diversification record in the securities business" was one reason for the downgrade, citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries.
22375009	"They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these," said Franklin President Duane H. Hall.
22375010	"I think it was a little premature on their part.
22376001	Just when it seemed safe to go back into stocks, Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves.
22376002	Does this signal another Black Monday is coming?
22376003	Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity, just like Oct. 19, 1987, eventually turned out to be?
22376004	Here's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday's action, what happens next and what investors should do.
22376005	Joseph Granville.
22376006	"I'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre, all through late August and September," says Mr. Granville, once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer.
22376007	"Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987," he says.
22376008	"Well, in some ways it is different, but technically it is just the same.
22376009	If you're a technician, you obey the signals.
22376010	Right now they're telling me to get the hell out and stay out.
22376011	I see no major support until 2200.
22376012	I see a possibility of going to 2200 this month."
22376013	Mr. Granville says he wouldn't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday.
22376014	"Most people," he says, "have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like."
22376015	Elaine Garzarelli.
22376016	A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash.
22376017	Friday's big drop, she says, "was not a crash.
22376018	This was an October massacre" like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979.
22376019	Now, as in those two years, her stock market indicators are positive.
22376020	So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained.
22376021	"Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12% down," she says.
22376022	"This is exactly the same thing, as far as I'm concerned."
22376023	Thus, she says, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below 2450, "It would just be a fluke.
22376024	My advice is to buy."
22376025	As she calculates it, the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies' earnings.
22376026	She says that ratio could climb to 14.5, given current interest rates, and still be within the range of "fair value."
22376027	Ned Davis.
22376028	Friday's fall marks the start of a bear market, says Mr. Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc.
22376029	But Mr. Davis, whose views are widely respected by money managers, says he expects no 1987-style crash.
22376030	"There was a unique combination in 1987," he says.
22376031	"Margin debt was at a record high.
22376032	There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds.
22376033	The main thing was portfolio insurance," a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses. "
22376034	A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject" to it.
22376035	In 1987, such selling contributed to a snowball effect.
22376036	Today could even be an up day, Mr. Davis says, if major brokerage firms agree to refrain from program trading.
22376037	Over the next several months, though, he says things look bad.
22376038	"I think the market will be heading down into November," he says.
22376039	"We will probably have a year-end rally, and then go down again.
22376040	Sort of a two-step bear market."
22376041	He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year.
22376042	"That would be a normal bear market," he says.
22376043	"I guess that's my forecast."
22376044	Leon G. Cooperman.
22376045	"I don't think the market is going through another October '87.
22376046	I don't think that's the case at all," says Mr. Cooperman, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
22376047	Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains, but he doesn't think there's any need to rush.
22376048	"I expect the market to open weaker Monday, but then it should find some stability."
22376049	He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago.
22376050	Unlike 1987, interest rates have been falling this year.
22376051	Unlike 1987, the dollar has been strong.
22376052	And unlike 1987, the economy doesn't appear to be in any danger of overheating.
22376053	But the economy's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits "isn't good," he says.
22376054	"So it's a very mixed bag."
22376055	Thus, he concludes, "This is not a good environment to be fully invested" in stocks.
22376056	"If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios, I would not do any buying.
22376057	But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio, so I would look to do some modest buying" on behalf of clients. "
22376058	We're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked" Friday.
22376059	John Kenneth Galbraith.
22376060	"This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity," says Mr. Galbraith, an economist.
22376061	"I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion," he says.
22376062	"The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity.
22376063	This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable."
22376064	Nevertheless, he says a depression doesn't appear likely.
22376065	"There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose," he says.
22376066	"It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try."
22376067	Mario Gabelli.
22376068	New York money manager Mario Gabelli, an expert at spotting takeover candidates, says that takeovers aren't totally gone.
22376069	"Companies are still going to buy companies around the world," he says.
22376070	Examples are "Ford looking at Jaguar, BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting."
22376071	These sorts of takeovers don't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them, so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue.
22376072	"The market was up 35% since {President} Bush took office," Mr. Gabelli says, so a correction was to be expected.
22376073	He thinks another crash is "unlikely," and says he was "nibbling at" selected stocks during Friday's plunge.
22376074	"Stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity {this} week for guys like me," he says.
22376075	Jim Rogers.
22376076	"It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon," says Mr. Rogers, a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history, Quantum Fund.
22376077	He sees "economic problems, financial problems" ahead for the U.S., with a fairly strong possibility of a recession.
22376078	"Friday you couldn't sell dollars," he says.
22376079	Dealers "would give you a quote, but then refuse to make the trade."
22376080	If the dollar stays weak, he says, that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much.
22376081	Mr. Rogers won't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go.
22376082	He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks, but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities, which often do well during periods of economic weakness.
22376083	Frank Curzio.
22376084	Many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash.
22376085	Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it: He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month.
22376086	Mr. Curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board.
22376087	If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks, he says, "That could quiet things down."
22376088	If not, "We could go to 2200 very soon."
22376089	Frank W. Terrizzi.
22376090	Stock prices "would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks," says Mr. Terrizzi, president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati.
22376091	Renaissance, which manages about $1.8 billion, drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally.
22376092	Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents, primarily U.S. Treasury bills.
22376093	"T-bills probably are the right place to be," he says.
22377001	Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging:
22377002	1. That your Sept. 28 editorial "Kangaroo Committees" was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading.
22377003	I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative.
22377004	2. That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of the witnesses to take the Fifth Amendment.
22377005	Yes, he did.
22377006	As I watched him on C-Span, I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings.
22377007	He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution.
22377008	He used about 56 words defending the witnesses' constitutional rights.
22377009	Unfortunately, by my rough guess, he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth.
22377010	He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary.
22377011	As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, "are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment.
22377012	" That certainly is not the supposed "distorted reading" indicated by Mr. Lantos.
22377013	3. That his "committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD.
22377014	My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court . . . etc."
22377015	Absolute rubbish.
22377016	By any "reasonable man" criterion, Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted.
22377017	Apparently, their verdict is in.
22377018	Right now they're pursuing evidence.
22377019	That's not a bad way to proceed, just somewhat different from standard American practice.
22377020	How was that practice referred to when I was in school?
22377021	Ah, yes, something called a Star Chamber.
22377022	Of course, Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change.
22377023	No doubt that's partially true.
22377024	Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true.
22377025	He's right about his subcommittee's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials.
22377026	But if his explanation of motivation is true, why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity?
22377027	Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency?
22377028	Such as, what happened when Congress wanted to know about $400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost?
22377029	No, Mr. Lantos's complaints simply won't wash.
22377030	4. That the Journal defends "the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD," etc. and so forth.
22377031	No, to my mind, the Journal did not "defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust . . ."
22377032	it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense.
22377033	The problem, which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles, is not the likes of Mr. Lantos, who after all is really a bit player on the stage, but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary/judicial body.
22377034	(Of course, we've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective.)
22377035	The system is the problem, not an individual member.
22377036	Individuals can always have their hands slapped.
22377037	It's when such slapping doesn't occur that we've got trouble.
22377038	I do not by any means defend HUD management.
22377039	But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency (and, yes, maybe criminality) within HUD could possibly generate.
22377040	The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when "Tail Gunner Joe" McCarthy did his work.

22377042	Parsippany, N.J.
22377043	I disagree with the statement by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in congressional hearings.
22377044	The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person "shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself."
22377045	This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify.
22377046	Thus, in a criminal case, a prosecutor cannot comment on a defendant's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness, thus forcing him to "take the Fifth."
22377047	The privilege, however, has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only.
22377048	The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that "the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause."
22377049	Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976).
22377050	Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
22377051	He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.
22377052	Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
22377053	Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify.
22377054	Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
22377055	The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.
22377056	Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination.

22378001	It was Friday the 13th, and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points.
22378002	Just a coincidence?
22378003	Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified?
22378004	In academia, a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors.
22378005	Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez, professors of finance at the University of Miami, found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th.
22378006	But their study, which spanned the 1962-85 period, has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data.
22378007	In the '70s, the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what.
22378008	But the date tends to be a plus, not a minus, for stocks, according to Yale Hirsch, a collector of stock market lore.
22378009	Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general, which tend to be strong days for stock prices.
22378010	On the only other Friday the 13th this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points.
22378011	Professor Kolb says the original study, titled Friday the 13th, Part VII, was published tongue-in-cheek.
22378012	In a similar vein, he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday's full moon could have played a part, too, in Friday's market activity.
22379001	reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated, some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered.
22379002	"We couldn't get dealers to answer their phones," said Robert King, senior vice president of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta.
22379003	"It was {like} the Friday before Black Monday" two years ago.
22379004	Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not, Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges.
22379005	Nonetheless, the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever, diving 14.90, or 3%, to 467.29.
22379006	Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading.
22379007	By comparison, the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8% Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4%.
22379008	On Oct. 16, 1987, the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.18 points, or 3.8%, followed by its devastating 46.12-point, or 11% slide, three days later.
22379009	Nasdaq volume Friday totaled 167.7 million shares, which was only the fifth busiest day so far this year.
22379010	The single-day record of 288 million shares was set on Oct. 21,
22379011	"There wasn't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved," said E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a New York company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues.
22379012	Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors.
22379013	Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders' inability to handle the volume of calls, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades.
22379014	The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies, which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who couldn't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash.
22379015	Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, declared: "It was the last hour of trading on a Friday.
22379016	There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots.
22379017	It wasn't intentional, we were all busy."
22379018	James Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, said, "It was just like two years ago.
22379019	Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time."
22379020	Jeremiah Mullins, the OTC trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading.
22379021	But, he added, "you can only take one call at a time."
22379022	Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur.
22379023	On days like Friday, that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to.
22379024	When selling is so frenzied, prices fall steeply and fast.
22379025	Two years ago, faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories, market makers themselves began dumping shares, exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices.
22379026	On Friday, some market makers were selling again, traders said.
22379027	But, with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash, companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand.
22379028	Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place, as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares.
22379029	"Everyone was hitting everyone else's bid," he said.
22379030	So, while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday, trading officials said the damage wasn't as bad as it was in 1987.
22379031	"Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit.
22379032	I don't know of anyone carrying big inventories now," said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey.
22379033	Tony Cecin, head of equity trading at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday.
22379034	It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago, he said.
22379035	Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system, said that despite the rush of selling, he never considered the situation an "emergency."
22379036	"The pace of trading was orderly," he said.
22379037	Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System "worked beautifully," as did the automated system for larger trades, according to Mr. Hardiman.
22379038	Nevertheless, the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors' confidence.
22379039	In the past, the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation.
22379040	Because Nasdaq's trading volume hasn't returned to pre-crash levels, traders and OTC market officials hope the damage won't be permanent.
22379041	But they are worried.
22379042	"We were just starting to get the public's confidence back," lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter.
22379043	More troubling is the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently erode the base of small-investor support the OTC market was struggling to rebuild in the wake of the October 1987 crash.
22379044	Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears.
22379045	It won't take much more to "scare the hell out of retail investors," he says.
22379046	The sellers on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors, as well as individual investors and market makers.
22379047	But grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares, compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago.
22379048	Shearson's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt.
22379049	Institutional investors, which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter, were calmer.
22379050	"We had a good amount of selling from institutions, but not as much panic," Mr. DaPuzzo said.
22379051	"If they couldn't sell, some of them put the shares back on the shelf."
22379052	In addition, he said, some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down.
22379053	In addition, Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index sent occasional "waves " through the market.
22379054	Nasdaq's biggest stocks were hammered.
22379055	The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues, including the big OTC technology issues, tumbled 4.2%, or 19.76, to 449.33.
22379056	The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2%, or 9.31, to 462.98.
22379057	The OTC market has only a handful of takeover-related stocks.
22379058	But they fell sharply.
22379059	McCaw Cellular Communications, for instance, has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as Metromedia's New York City cellular telephone interests, and in a separate transaction, sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular.
22379060	McCaw lost 8%, or 3 1/2, to 40.
22379061	LIN Broadcasting, dropped 5 1/2, or 5%, to 107 1/2.
22379062	The turnover in both issues was roughly normal.
22379063	On a day when negative takeover-related news didn't sit well with investors, Commercial Intertech, a maker of engineered metal parts, said Haas & Partners advised it that it doesn't plan to pursue its previously reported $27.50-a-share bid to buy the company.
22379064	Commercial Intertech plummeted 6 to 26.
22379065	The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday.
22379066	On the OTC market, First Executive, a big buyer of the high-risk, high-yield issues, slid 2 to 12 1/4.
22379067	Among other OTC issues, Intel, dropped 2 1/8 to 33 7/8; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1/8 to 19 1/2; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1/4 to 10 1/4; MCI Communications slipped 2 1/4 to 43 1/2; Apple Computer fell 3 to 45 3/4 and Nike dropped 2 1/4 to 66 3/4.

22381001	Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said they began scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
22381002	And they plan to buy more today.
22381003	Rightly or wrongly, many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash: Buying at the bottom pays off.
22381004	To be sure, big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today.
22381005	They could still panic and bail out of the market.
22381006	But their 1987 performance indicates that they won't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse.
22381007	"Last time, we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst," said John W. Rogers, president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc., which manages $1.1 billion of stocks.
22381008	Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for "our favorite stocks that have fallen apart."
22381009	He expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further.
22381010	Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig wasn't daunted when Friday's rout shaved $40 million from the value of the $752 million Janus Fund he oversees.
22381011	"I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through," he said.
22381012	Then he jumped into the market:
22381013	"I spent $30 million in the last half-hour."
22381014	Other money managers also opened their wallets.
22381015	"I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn.
22381016	"There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash."
22381017	Unlike mutual funds, which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money, big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock.
22381018	Most often, they do just that, because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment, attracting about $1 trillion from pension funds alone.
22381019	"If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom," said Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
22381020	The $56 billion California Public Employees Retirement System, for one, added $1 billion to its stock portfolio two years ago.
22381021	"The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad," said Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
22381022	"Those that pulled out (of stocks) regretted it," he said, "so I doubt you'll see any significant changes" in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline.
22381023	Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have been stellar performers this year, rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends.
22381024	Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades.
22381025	"You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market," said James D. Awad, president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp.
22381026	Mr. Awad, however, worries that the market "could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days.
22381027	It can happen before you can turn around."
22381028	He said he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading.
22381029	"The only thing you don't have," he said, "is the `portfolio insurance' phenomenon overlaid on the rest."
22381030	Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash.
22381031	Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts.
22381032	In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected.
22381033	Even without portfolio insurance, market conditions were grim Friday, money managers said.
22381034	Neil Weisman, whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85% of its $220 million investment pool to cash in recent months, said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands.
22381035	"We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything," said Mr. Weisman, who, happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier, declined the offers.
22381036	Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again, trapping more investors.
22381037	"I think it will be a rigor mortis rally," he said.
22381038	Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.
22381039	Especially gleeful were the short sellers, who have been pounded by this year's market climb.
22381040	The shorts sell borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price.
22381041	The nation's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers, Palo Alto, Calif., which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point.
22381042	All that now has changed.
22381043	"We're ahead for the year because of Friday," said the firm's Kurt Feshbach.
22381044	"We're not making a killing, but we had a good day.
22382001	Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney's office in Baltimore.
22382002	Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens, N.Y., company's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes.
22382003	Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests.
22382004	Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic.
22382005	But so far the company hasn't complied with that request, the spokesman said.
22382006	Bolar, the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General's office of the Health and Human Services Department, only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin "as far down as direct customers, mostly wholesalers," Mr. Nesbit said.
22382007	Bolar, of Copiague, N.Y., earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug.
22382008	The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin.
22382009	Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing.
22383001	The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands.
22383002	The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders.
22383003	Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged, though unsuccessfully, ASKO's Dutch lawyers noted.
22383004	Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV.
22383005	ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders.
22383006	Speaking through its Dutch lawyers, ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15% stake in Ahold.
22383007	It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6% stake that was accumulated since July.
22383008	A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue.
22383009	He termed ASKO's legal actions as "unproductive" to international cooperation among European retailers.
22384001	Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican, but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush's economic policy-making.
22384002	"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that have to be the subject of major initiatives," he said in an interview.
22384003	"I'd like to see that initiative, and I haven't.
22384004	There isn't a big shot, an agenda."
22384005	A few hours later, the stock market dropped 190 points.
22384006	Politicians tried to finger each other for the blame, although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street's woes.
22384007	But Mr. Butcher's comments make one thing clear: Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy.
22384008	Consider this:
22384009	-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight, President Bush must order $16 billion of automatic, across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law.
22384010	The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill.
22384011	"We simply don't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices," House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) said yesterday on NBC News's "Meet the Press."
22384012	-- For the last two weeks, the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy.
22384013	The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower; the Fed has been resisting.
22384014	"One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board," said Lawrence Kudlow, a Bear, Stearns & Co. economist, on ABC's "This Week."
22384015	-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers.
22384016	Last month, Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
22384017	But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision.
22384018	And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines, which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC.
22384019	Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop.
22384020	In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash.
22384021	Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.
22384022	The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve.
22384023	And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous.
22384024	The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit, resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $12 billion during that period.
22384025	But, barring further drops in the market this week, a similar outcome doesn't seem likely this year.
22384026	Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday's drop, by itself, isn't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring's gimmick-ridden plan, which still isn't fully implemented.
22384027	One of the biggest reasons that new talks aren't likely to come about is that, as everyone learned in 1987, the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble.
22384028	"Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929, that we were looking at a recession," Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview.
22384029	"That did not happen.
22384030	They learned they could survive it without much problem."
22384031	But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta, who said a precipitous drop this week "is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy."
22384032	In that case, there will be plenty of blame to go around.
22384033	"There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be-that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas).
22384034	Nevertheless, it clearly will take more than Friday's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight.
22384035	Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation.
22384036	"There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply didn't live up to this year's deal," Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on CBS News's "Face the Nation."
22384037	During last week's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue, there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds.
22384038	At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president's policy to include it.
22384039	When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, hailed it.
22384040	Asked if the administration agreed, he curtly replied: "The adminstration will have to speak for itself."
22384041	Friday's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure, a process that isn't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest.
22384042	Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate, which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit.
22384043	"The market needs a strong signal that we're serious about deficit reduction, and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill" of similar provisions, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.). said yesterday.
22384044	The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion.
22384045	Rep. Panetta said that OMB's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts, but added: "We're getting very close to the margins here."
22384046	No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday's drop in the stock market.
22384047	But some players were quick to seize the moment.
22384048	Before the sun had set on Friday, Richard Rahn, the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains.
22384049	"Investors, who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell, were spooked," he said.
22384050	"There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut," Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance, "but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others.

22386001	Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend, but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market.
22386002	"I'm not losing faith in the market," said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm.
22386003	But he's not so sure about everyone else.
22386004	"I think on Monday the small (investors) are going to panic and sell," predicted Mr. Sullivan, whose investments include AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit and several mutual funds.
22386005	"And I think institutions are going to come in and buy . . .
22386006	I'm going to hold on.
22386007	If I sell now, I'll take a big loss."
22386008	Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they didn't flee the market in 1987.
22386009	"Oh, I bet it'll be up 50 points on Monday," said Lucy Crump, a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington, Ky.
22386010	Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash, "but no one got discouraged, and we gained that back -- and more."
22386011	At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis, the scene was calm.
22386012	Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday.
22386013	But Robert Showalter, an official of the association, said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors' clubs are planned.
22386014	In fact, some of the association's members -- long-term, buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices.
22386015	"We hope to take advantage of it," said John Snyder, a member of a Los Angeles investors' club.
22386016	He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants.
22386017	Not everyone is reacting so calmly, however, and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday's slide, reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
22386018	Marc Perkins, a Tampa, Fla., investment banker, said the market drop is one of "a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending.
22386019	There's no question that there's a general distaste for leverage among lenders.
22386020	" Mr. Perkins believes, however, that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $275 a share.
22386021	Sara Albert, a 34-year-old Dallas law student, says she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it.
22386022	"I have this feeling that it's built on sand," she says, that the market rises "but there's no foundation to it."
22386023	She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash, although she still owns some Texaco stock.
22386024	Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school, "I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid."
22386025	Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand.
22386026	"We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot," said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg.
22386027	"We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime, come on back.
22386028	Now it's happening again."
22386029	Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and, to his regret, never went back even as the market soared.
22386030	This time he's ready to buy in "when the panic wears off."
22386031	Still, he adds: "We can't have this kind of thing happen very often.
22386032	When the little guy gets frightened, the big guys hurt badly.
22386033	Merrill Lynch can't survive without the little guy."
22386034	Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday, but mostly through mutual funds.
22386035	Discount brokerage customers "have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago," says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm.
22386036	Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corp., says Schwab customers "have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks."
22386037	Individual investors are still angry about program trading, Mr. Quackenbush says.
22386038	Avner Arbel, a Cornell University finance professor, says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to "win back the confidence of the small investor."
22386039	But it's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried.
22386040	Alan Helfman, general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston, said he and his mother have some joint stock investments, but the overall economy is his chief worry.
22386041	"These high rollers took a big bath today," he said in his showroom, which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston's richest citizens.
22386042	"And I can tell you that a high roller isn't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati."
22386043	And, finally, there were the gloaters.
22386044	"I got out in 1987.
22386045	Everything," said Pascal Antori, an Akron, Ohio, plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments' LaSalle Street office.
22386046	"I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost."
22386047	Would Mr. Antori ever get back in?
22386048	"Are you kidding!
22386049	When it comes to money: Once bitten, 2,000 times shy.
22387001	The crowded field for notebook-sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded.
22387002	Compaq Computer Corp.'s long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market, especially Zenith Electronics Corp., the current market leader, and on a swarm of promising start-ups.
22387003	Compaq's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market.
22387004	One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad, and two others have introduced even smaller "palmtops."
22387005	But those machines are still considered novelties, with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match.
22387006	Compaq's notebooks, by contrast, may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines.
22387007	Analysts say they're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they're priced aggressively at $2,400 to $5,000.
22387008	All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases.
22387009	In recent months, Compaq's competition, including Zenith, Toshiba Corp., Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly.
22387010	One analyst, noting that most such machines are about two inches thick, takes exception to the name.
22387011	"This isn't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook," he says.
22387012	That can't be said of the $2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp., a unit of Tandy.
22387013	Instead of a keyboard, it features a writing surface, an electronic pen and the ability to "read" block printing.
22387014	At 4 1/2 pounds, it may be too ambitiously named, but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth.
22387015	Palmtops aren't far behind.
22387016	Atari Corp.'s Portfolio, introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September, weighs less than a pound, costs a mere $400 and runs on three AA batteries, yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs.
22387017	Some critics, however, say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory.
22387018	Poquet Computer Corp., meanwhile, has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs, but costs five times as much.
22387019	At stake is what Mike Swavely, Compaq's president of North America operations, calls "the Holy Grail of the computer industry" -- the search for "a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere."
22387020	The market is so new, nobody knows yet how big it can be.
22387021	"I've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is," says Tom Humphries, director of marketing for GRiD.
22387022	"Whether it's $5 billion or $3.5 billion, it doesn't matter.
22387023	It's huge."
22387024	Consider the growth of portables, which now comprise 12% of all personal computer sales.
22387025	Laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment, with sales doubling this year.
22387026	Responding to that demand, however, has led to a variety of compromises.
22387027	Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory.
22387028	It also has precluded use of the faster, more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines.
22387029	Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays.
22387030	The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times.
22387031	A Poquet spokesman, for example, criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two.
22387032	Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers, who argue that they're too small -- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups, admits Gerry Purdy, director of marketing.
22387033	Poquet, trying to avoid the "gadget" label, responded with the tag line, "The Poquet PC -- a Very Big Computer."
22387034	Despite the sniping, few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that don't make compromises.
22387035	Toward that end, experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba, Zenith and now Compaq.
22387036	Compaq's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like Dynabook Inc., which introduced in June a computer that, like Compaq's, uses an Intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive.
22387037	But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq's.
22387038	Compaq's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith, which last year had 28% of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull, the French government-owned computer maker.
22387039	Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $635 million sale, a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith's share and sales.
22387040	Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith's market share.
22387041	Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive officer, notes pointedly that Zenith's $2,000 MinisPort uses an "unconventional" two-inch floppy disk, whereas Compaq's new machines use the more common 3 1/2-inch disk.
22387042	John P. Frank, president of Zenith Data Systems, simply shrugs off such criticism, noting that 3 1/2-inch floppies were also "unconventional" when they first replaced five-inch disks.
22387043	"We don't look at it as not being a standard, we look at it as a new standard," he argues.
22387044	Analysts don't see it that way.
22387045	"I can't imagine that you'll talk to anyone who won't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else," says Gene Talsky, president of Professional Marketing Management Inc.
22387046	Adds Bill Lempesis, senior industry analyst for DataQuest, a high-technology market research firm: "We basically think that these are very hot products.
22387047	The problem Compaq is going to have is that they won't be able to make enough of them."
22387048	Compaq's machines include the 3 1/2-inch floppy disk drive, a backlit screen that is only 1/4-inch thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words, almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine.
22387049	Others undoubtedly will follow, but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition.
22387050	Toshiba's line of portables, for example, features the T-1000, which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory, and the T-1600, which also uses a 286 microprocessor, but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size.
22387051	A third model, marketed in Japan, may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990, but by then, analysts say, Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players.
22387052	What about Big Blue?
22387053	International Business Machines Corp., analysts say, has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon.
22388001	Honeywell Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. received Air Force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space.
22388002	Honeywell's contract totaled $69.7 million, and IBM's $68.8 million.
22388003	Boeing Co. received a $46.7 million Air Force contract for developing cable systems for the Minuteman Missile.
22388004	General Dynamics Corp. received a $29 million Air Force contract for electronic-warfare training sets.
22388005	Grumman Corp. received an $18.1 million Navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics.
22388006	Avco Corp. received an $11.8 million Army contract for helicopter engines.
22389001	Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1% from the previous month, pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8%, the National Institute of Statistics said Friday.
22389002	The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years.
22389003	The index, which registered 156.8 at the end of September, has a base of 100 set in 1983 and isn't seasonally adjusted.
22389004	Prices have risen 5.9% in the first nine months of the year, outstripping both the initial 3% inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second, revised goal of 5.8%.
22390001	Japan's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3% from a year earlier and were up 0.4% from the previous month, the Bank of Japan announced Friday.
22390002	The wholesale price index stood at 90.1, compared with a 1985 base of 100.
22391001	Plunge?
22391002	What plunge?
22391003	Twenty-four New York Stock Exchange issues hit 52-week highs during Friday's trading, despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 190.58-point plunge.
22391004	Stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell-off.
22391005	And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
22391006	Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Exxon Corp. and Cigna Corp., the big insurer.
22391007	Of course, many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows.
22391008	These included International Business Machines Corp., which during Friday's session traded below $100 a share for the first time since June 1984.
22391009	IBM closed at $102, down $5.625.
22391010	Other new lows included Navistar International Corp., Union Carbide Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp., all of which are included in the industrial average.
22391011	Meanwhile, two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over-the-counter trading Friday.
22391012	Shares of Rally's Inc., an operator of fast-food restaurants, closed at $17 each, up from its $15 offering price and shares of Employee Benefit Plans Inc., a health-care consultant, closed at $14.125, up from its $12 offering price.
22392001	Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5% of the shares in Jaguar PLC.
22392002	Jaguar, the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions, the company said.
22392003	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it wouldn't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15% of Jaguar shares.
22392004	The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15% of the British luxury-car maker, the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions.
22392005	General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares.
22392006	GM said it still is talking with Jaguar about acquiring a minority interest.
22393001	Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is, "on margin" -- may be more worried than most following Friday's market drop.
22393002	That's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans.
22393003	In October 1987, these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market.
22393004	Typically, a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75% of its original value.
22393005	If the investor doesn't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call, the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities.
22393006	But some big brokerage firms said they don't expect major problems as a result of margin calls.
22393007	Margin calls since Friday "have been higher than usual, but reasonable," a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said.
22393008	Merrill Lynch & Co. officials "don't expect {margin calls} to be as big a factor as in 1987" because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin, a spokesman said.
22393009	Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp., the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm, said he didn't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers.
22393010	He said Schwab had increased margin requirements "so customers have more of a cushion."
22393011	He added: "We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility.
22394001	Avis Inc., following rival Hertz Corp.'s lead, said it is backing out of frequent-flier programs with three airlines.
22394002	The Garden City, N.Y., car-rental company said it won't renew contracts with NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit, Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year.
22394003	But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines.
22394004	Industry estimates put Avis's annual cost of all five programs at between $8 million and $14 million.
22394005	A spokesman for Avis wouldn't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for "far less than half" of the total.
22394006	Budget Rent a Car Corp., of Chicago, and National Car Rental Systems Inc., of Minneapolis, both said they had no plans to follow suit.
22394007	In fact, Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs, in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts.
22394008	"I cannot see how this news by Hertz and Avis cannot benefit Budget's programs," said Bob Wilson, Budget's vice president, marketing planning.
22394009	Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements.
22394010	National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines, including Delta and USAir Group Inc.'s USAir unit.
22394011	A month ago, Hertz, of Park Ridge, N.J., said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta, America West and Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, and that pacts with American Airlines, UAL Inc's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended. . . sometime after Dec. 31.
22394012	At the time, Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $15 million.
22394013	Analysts and competitors, however, doubt the numbers were that high.
22394014	Budget said its frequent-flier costs are "substantially below" Avis's level.
22394015	Robert D. Cardillo, Avis vice president of marketing, said, "The proliferation and costs attached to {frequent-flier programs} have significantly diminished their value."
22394016	This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis, said Charles Finnie, car-rental industry analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons.
22394017	"They've been looking to get their costs down, and this is a fairly sensible way to do it," he said.
22395001	CBS Inc. is cutting "The Pat Sajak Show" down to one hour from its current 90 minutes.
22395002	CBS insisted the move wasn't a setback for the program, which is the network's first entry into the late-night talk show format since 1972.
22395003	"I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it," said Rod Perth, who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August.
22395004	"This will raise the energy level of the show."
22395005	CBS will continue to program action-adventure shows to follow the Sajak hour.
22395006	But CBS News will extend its four-hour "Nightwatch" by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m.
22395007	The show, despite a promising start, has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co., finishing far below "Tonight" on NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., and "Nightline" on ABC-TV, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
22395008	Further fractioning the late-night audience is the addition of the "Arsenio Hall Show," syndicated by Paramount Communications Inc.
22396001	Tandem Computers Inc., preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business, said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.
22396002	Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share.
22396003	The results, which are in line with analysts' estimates, reflect "a continued improvement in our U.S. business," said James Treybig, Tandem's chief executive officer.
22396004	In the year-earlier period, Tandem reported net income of $30.1 million, or 31 cents a share, on revenue of $383.9 million.
22396005	Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week.
22396006	Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino, Calif., company will report revenue of $430 million to $460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share.
22396007	Commenting on the results for the quarter, Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company's domestic business came as "a surprise" to him, noting that sales "in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan."
22396008	The company's U.S. performance was helped by "a record quarter for new customers," he said.
22396009	Tandem makes "fault-tolerant" computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges, networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems.
22396010	Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever, which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers.
22396011	Tandem's new high-end computer is called Cyclone.
22396012	Prices for the machine, which can come in various configurations, are $2 million to $10 million.
22396013	Analysts expect the new computer to wrest a hefty slice of business away from IBM, the longtime leader in mainframes.
22396014	"We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from IBM" over the next few years, said George Weiss, an analyst at the Gartner group.
22396015	That will spur Tandem's growth.
22396016	"I'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20% next year," said John Levinson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
22396017	IBM is expected to respond to Tandem's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes, which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem.
22396018	"Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately," said Mr. Weiss.
22396019	But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue's machines.
22396020	"The answer isn't price reductions, but new systems," he said.
22396021	Nevertheless, Tandem faces a variety of challenges, the biggest being that customers generally view the company's computers as complementary to IBM's mainframes.
22396022	Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion, insisting that Tandem's new machines aren't replacements for IBM's mainframes.
22396023	"We're after a little bigger niche," he said.
22397001	Don't jump yet.
22397002	The stock market's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy.
22397003	In one wild hour of trading, the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do, unsuccessfully, for weeks.
22397004	It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar.
22397005	The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed, the entire economy.
22397006	This may sound strangely optimistic.
22397007	After all, until a few years ago, the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy.
22397008	When it went down, by all tradition, the economy followed.
22397009	That has changed, partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable.
22397010	The 1987 crash was "a false alarm however you view it," says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz.
22397011	The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation.
22397012	Its spasms can't be traced to fundamental business conditions, nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy.
22397013	"The market today has a life of its own," John Akers, chairman of International Business Machines Corp., said Saturday.
22397014	"There's nothing rational about this kind of action."
22397015	Of course, the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week.
22397016	Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth, damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance.
22397017	The financial-services industry was battered by the 1987 crash.
22397018	What's more, although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago, the U.S. economy is weaker.
22397019	Growth is slower.
22397020	Profits are softer.
22397021	Debt burdens are heavier.
22397022	But if the stock market doesn't continue to plummet, the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate.
22397023	The Fed, which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit, is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets.
22397024	Fed officials may protest that this doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies.
22397025	But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets.
22397026	Anticipating the Fed's move, money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625% late Friday, down from 8.820% the day before.
22397027	Tiny movements in the rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets.
22397029	Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals, threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years.
22397030	The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar.
22397033	Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 isn't so comforting.
22397034	In the third quarter of 1987, the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3%.
22397035	The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3% in the third quarter of 1989, which ended two weeks ago.
22397036	The plunge in stock prices "is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down," says economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting company.
22397037	"A lot of pent-up demand is gone."
22397038	Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- "but only slightly and for a short period of time," recalls Mr. Zarnowitz, a longtime student of business cycles.
22397039	"That was offset by strength elsewhere.
22397040	{The effects} were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected.
22397041	" Today, he frets, exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction.
22397042	What's more, the corporate borrowing binge hasn't abated in the past two years.
22397043	"We've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt . . . just at the time when earnings are being squeezed," Mr. Chimerine notes.
22397044	The more a company relies on borrowed money, the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown.
22397045	A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court.
22397046	The Fed, of course, knows that very well -- hence its readiness to pump credit into the economy this morning.
22397047	But, in the process, the Fed risks reigniting inflation.
22397048	Even before Friday's events, Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed won't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets, banks and highly leveraged corporations.
22397049	The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now isn't recession, he reasons; it's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation.
22397050	In the end, the 1987 collapse suggested, the economy doesn't move in lockstep with stock prices.
22397051	The economy does, however, depend on the confidence of businesses, consumers and foreign investors.
22397052	A panic on Wall Street doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
22397053	Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday.
22397054	A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent; multiply that a few times over, though, and it will.
22397055	If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline.
22397056	And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.
22397057	On the bottom line, the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we've been through this before.
22397058	Two years ago, about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression.
22397059	The doomsayers had a receptive audience.
22397060	The prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today.
22397061	At the very least, the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation's success in handling the last go-around.
22397062	As Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) observed yesterday, "The Fed avoided a meltdown last time.
22397063	They are more sophisticated this time.
22398001	The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business.
22398002	Producers of commodity chemicals, the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers, have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers.
22398003	Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry's now fading boom, these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter.
22398004	"For some of these companies, this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons," says Leonard Bogner, a chemical industry analyst at Prudential Bache Research.
22398005	"This could be the first of five or six down quarters."
22398006	Perhaps most prominent, Dow Chemical Co., which as of midyear had racked up eight consecutive record quarters, is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier, if only by a shade.
22398007	Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the company still has a big stake in polyethylene, which is used in packaging and housewares.
22398008	Analysts' third-quarter estimates for the Midland, Mich., company are between $3.20 a share and $3.30 a share, compared with $3.36 a year ago, when profit was $632 million on sales of $4.15 billion.
22398009	A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates.
22398010	At the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8% to 10%.
22398011	"You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better," says James Wilbur, a Smith Barney analyst.
22398012	First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit.
22398013	Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations.
22398014	Still, some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains, largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals.
22398015	Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments, fibers and polymers.
22398016	Moreover, the Wilmington, Del., company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs, such as ethylene.
22398017	Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its Conoco Inc. oil company.
22398018	The estimates for Du Pont range from $2.25 to $2.45 a share.
22398019	In the 1988 third quarter, the company earned $461 million, or $1.91 a share, on sales of $7.99 billion.
22398020	Du Pont declined to comment.
22398022	The St. Louis-based company is expected to report again that losses in its G.D. Searle & Co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing.
22398023	Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year, but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989.
22398024	Most estimates for Monsanto run between $1.70 and $2 a share.
22398025	A year ago, the company posted third-quarter profit of $116 million, or $1.67 a share, on sales of $2.02 billion.
22398026	Monsanto declined to comment.
22398027	But the commodity-chemical producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle.
22398028	By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry, the inventory reductions are near an end, which may presage firmer demand.
22398029	But doubters say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s.
22398030	In the latest quarter, at least, profit is expected to fall sharply.
22398031	For Himont Inc., "how far down it is, we don't know," says Leslie Ravitz at Salomon Brothers.
22398032	The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents, compared with a restated $1.65 a share a year earlier, when profit was $107.8 million on sales of $435.5 million.
22398033	Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product, polypropylene, while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene, whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries.
22398034	The company, based in Wilmington, Del., is 81%-owned by Montedison S.p.A., Milan, which has an offer outstanding for the Himont shares it doesn't already own.
22398035	At Quantum Chemical Corp., New York, the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene, higher debt costs and the idling of an important plant due to an explosion.
22398036	Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum, because it isn't known when the company will book certain one-time charges.
22398037	But the estimates range from break-even to 35 cents a share.
22398038	In the 1988 third quarter, Quantum earned $99.8 million, or $3.92 a share, on sales of $724.4 million.
22398039	Another big polyethylene producer, Union Carbide Corp., is expected to post profit of between $1 a share and $1.25, compared with $1.56 a share a year earlier, when the company earned $213 million on sales of $2.11 billion.
22398040	Himont, Quantum and Union Carbide all declined to comment.
22399001	The following were among Friday's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets, with terms and syndicate manager, as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report:

22399012	The offering, Series 102, backed by Freddie Mac 8 1/2% securities with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 28.4 years, was priced before the market's afternoon surge.
22399013	Among classes for which details were available, yields ranged from 8.78%, or 75 basis points over two-year Treasury securities, to 10.05%, or 200 basis points over 10-year Treasurys.

22399015	$300 million of Remic mortgage securities offered by Citicorp Securities Markets Inc.

22399017	Pricing details weren't immediately available.
22399018	Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. --
22399019	$200 million of stripped mortgage securities underwritten by BT Securities Corp.
22399020	The agency's first strips issue, collateralized by Freddie Mac 8% securities pooled into a single security called a Giant, will be divided into interest-only and principal-only securities.
22399021	The collateral is being sold by a thrift institution.
22399022	The principal-only securities will be repackaged by BT Securities into a Freddie Mac Remic, Series 103, that will have six classes.
22399023	The interest-only securities will be sold separately by BT Securities.
22399024	The principal-only securities pay the principal from the underlying Freddie Mac 8% securities, while the interest-only securities pay only interest.
22399025	Freddie Mac said the principal-only securities were priced at 58 1/4 to yield 8.45%, assuming an average life of eight years and a prepayment of 160% of the PSA model.
22399026	The interest-only securities were priced at 35 1/2 to yield 10.72%.
22399027	There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday.
22400001	The economy's temperature will be taken from several vantage points this week, with readings on trade, output, housing and inflation.
22400002	The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow.
22400003	The trade gap is expected to widen to about $9 billion from July's $7.6 billion, according to a survey by MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.
22400004	Thursday's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise, although not as sharply as the 0.9% gain reported Friday in the producer price index.
22400005	That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday's session, before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge.
22400006	Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization, also due tomorrow.
22400007	Meanwhile, September housing starts, due Wednesday, are thought to have inched upward.
22400008	"There's a possibility of a surprise" in the trade report, said Michael Englund, director of research at MMS.
22400009	A widening of the deficit, if it were combined with a stubbornly strong dollar, would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted.
22400010	In any event, Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made.
22400011	"Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow," he said.
22400012	Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August, but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports, economists said.
22400013	Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations.
22400014	The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences: The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5% to an increase of 0.4%, according to MMS.
22400015	A rebound in energy prices, which helped push up the producer price index, is expected to do the same in the consumer price report.
22400016	The consensus view expects a 0.4% increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August.
22400017	Robert H. Chandross, an economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level.
22400018	"Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI, and at the CPI level they won't," he said.
22400019	Food prices are expected to be unchanged, but energy costs jumped as much as 4%, said Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group.
22400020	He also says he thinks "core inflation," which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was strong last month.
22400021	He expects a gain of as much as 0.5% in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases.
22400022	Housing starts are expected to quicken a bit from August's annual pace of 1,350,000 units.
22400023	Economists say an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts, though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards.

22402001	Assuming the stock market doesn't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms, American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain's concept of both.
22402002	"Capital City" is a weekly series that premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer, Thames Television.
22402003	The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987.
22402004	Let's make that 1929, just to be sure.
22402005	According to the program's publicity prospectus, "Capital City," set at Shane Longman, a fictional mid-sized securities firm with #500 million capital, "follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young, high-flying dealers, hired for their particular blend of style, genius and energy.
22402006	But with all the money and glamour of high finance come the relentless pressures to do well; pressure to pull off another million before lunch; pressure to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second . . ."
22402007	You needn't be a high-powered securities lawyer to realize the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure.
22402008	The slickly produced series has been criticized by London's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail, but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters' professional and private lives.
22402009	Turned loose in Shane Longman's trading room, the yuppie dealers do little right.
22402010	Judging by the money lost and mistakes made in the early episodes, Shane Longman's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week.
22402011	In the opening episode we learn that Michelle, a junior bond trader, has indeed pulled off another million before lunch.
22402012	Trouble is, she has lost it just as quickly.
22402013	Rather than keep the loss a secret from the outside world, Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while ordering lunch over the phone.
22402014	Little chance that Shane Longman is going to recoup today.
22402015	Traders spend the morning frantically selling bonds, in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy.
22402016	Ah, perfidious Columbia!
22402017	The trade figures turn out well, and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price.
22402018	So much for anticipating the market by a fraction of a second.
22402019	And a large slice of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds (since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays?).
22402020	Surprisingly, Shane Longman survives the week, only to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation.
22402021	Instead of closing ranks to protect the firm's reputation, the executive's internal rivals, led by a loutish American, demand his resignation.
22402022	The plot is thwarted when the firm's major stockholder, kelp farming on the other side of the globe, hurries home to support the executive.
22402023	But the investigation continues.
22402024	If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries, you still are left puzzled, because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously.
22402025	In fact, few consume much of anything.
22402026	Two share a house almost devoid of furniture.
22402027	Michelle lives in a hotel room, and although she drives a canary-colored Porsche, she hasn't time to clean or repair it; the beat-up vehicle can be started only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock.
22402028	And it takes Declan, the obligatory ladies' man of the cast, until the third episode to get past first base with any of his prey.
22402029	Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class-conscious Britain isn't ready to come to terms with the wealth created by the Thatcherian free-enterprise regime.
22402030	After all, this isn't old money, but new money, and in many cases, young money.
22402031	This attitude is clearly illustrated in the treatment of Max, the trading room's most flamboyant character.
22402032	Yuppily enough, he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church, wears designer clothes and drives an antique car.
22402033	But apparently to make him palatable, even lovable, to the masses, the script inflates pony-tailed Max into an eccentric genius, master of 11 Chinese dialects.
22402034	He takes his wash to the laundromat, where he meets a punky French girl who dupes him into providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe.
22402035	In producing and promoting "Capital City," Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day.
22402036	The production costs are a not inconsiderable #8 million ($12.4 million), and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of "Dealers," an earlier made-for-TV movie.
22402037	Another half million quid went for a volley of full-page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway.
22402038	These expenses create a special incentive for "Capital City's" producers to flog it, or a Yank-oriented version of it, in America.
22402039	Thames's U.S. marketing agent, Donald Taffner, is preparing to do just that.
22402040	He is discreetly hopeful, citing three U.S. comedy series -- "Three's Company," "Too Close for Comfort" and "Check It Out" -- that had British antecedents.
22402041	Perhaps without realizing it, Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution: "Capital City" should have been a comedy, a worthy sequel to the screwball British "Carry On" movies of the 1960s.
22402042	The seeds already are in the script.
22402043	The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading-room crew minded a baby, the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm.
22402044	And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles.
22402045	Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor; William Armstrong, who plays Max, could pass for Hans Conreid, and Douglas Hodge (Declan) for James Farentino; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall, the blank-faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies.
22402046	So, OK kids, everybody on stage for "Carry On Trading": The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly have soared in value because Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House.
22402047	The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa, who slaps a security guard.
22402048	He backflips into a desktop computer terminal, which explodes, covering Huntz Hall's face with microchips.
22402049	And all the while, the bonds are in the baby's diaper.
22402050	It should run forever.

22403001	Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc., in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates.
22403002	The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers.
22403003	In an attempt to appease U.S. regulators' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers, Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T.
22403004	As part of the agreement, Axa agreed to invest $1 billion in Hoylake Investments Ltd., Sir James's acquisition vehicle.
22403005	Of the total $5.5 billion to be paid to Hoylake by Axa, about $1 billion will come from available resources of Axa's parent, Axa-Midi Group, $2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by Axa, and the remaining $2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans.
22403006	In an interview Thursday, Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer of Axa, said his group has already obtained assurances from a group of banks led by Cie. Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing.
22403007	The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp, he said.
22403008	Mr. Bebear said Axa-Midi Group has "more than $2.5 billion of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell" to help pay off debt from the acquisition.
22403009	He said the assets to be sold would be "non-insurance" assets, including a beer company and a real estate firm, and wouldn't include any pieces of Farmers.
22403010	"We won't put any burden on Farmers," he said.
22403011	The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement, Hoylake has an absolute obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T.
22403012	"We hope that with what we did, the regulators will not need to evaluate Hoylake, and they can directly look at the agreement with us, because Hoylake won't be an owner of Farmers at anytime," Mr. Bebear said.
22403013	Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated.
22403014	The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake, and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition.
22403015	Hoylake dropped its initial #13.35 billion ($20.71 billion) takeover bid after it received the extension, but said it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval.
22403016	A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that, "It would appear that nothing substantive has changed.
22403017	The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one, and Axa still plans to take out 75% of Farmers' earnings as dividends to service their debt."
22403018	That dividend is almost double the 35% currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T, the spokesman added.
22403019	"It would have severe implications for Farmers' policy holders."
22403020	To fend off Sir James's advances, B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern.
22404001	Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October, the first sales period of the 1990 model year.
22404002	The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American-made cars in the first 10 days of October, a 12.6% drop from a year earlier.
22404003	Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4% to 86,555 pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles.
22404004	The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam, at least initially, out of 1990 model sales, which began officially Oct. 1.
22404005	This appears particularly true at GM, which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3% from last year's unusually high level.
22404006	Overall, sales of all domestic-made vehicles fell 11.9% from a year ago.
22404007	Without GM, overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results.
22404008	Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models, but they may have to broaden their programs to keep sales up.
22404009	"We've created a condition where, without incentives, it's a tough market," said Tom Kelly, sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn, Mich.
22404010	Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles, the lowest since October 1987.
22404011	The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month.
22404012	Furthermore, dealers contacted late last week said they couldn't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday's steep market decline.
22404013	GM's domestic car sales dropped 24.3% and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7% from the same period a year ago.
22404014	All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines.
22404015	Cadillac posted a 3.2% increase despite new competition from Lexus, the fledging luxury-car division of Toyota Motor Corp.
22404016	Lexus sales weren't available; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end.
22404017	The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing, a company spokesman said.
22404018	Last year, GM had a different program in place that continued rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold.
22404019	Aside from GM, other car makers posted generally mixed results.
22404020	Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8% drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4% increase in domestic truck sales.
22404021	Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5% drop in car sales, echoing its generally slow performance all year.
22404022	However, sales of trucks, including the company's popular minivans, rose 4.3%.
22404023	Honda Motor Co.'s sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7% from a year earlier.
22404024	Honda's plant in Marysville, Ohio, was gearing up to build 1990 model Accords, a Honda spokesman said.
22404025	"We're really confident everything will bounce back to normal," he added.
22404026	Separately, Chrysler said firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5% over comparably equipped 1989 models.
22404027	Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall.
22404028	At that time, Chrysler said base prices, which aren't adjusted for equipment changes, would rise between 4% and 9% on most vehicle.
22404029	a-Totals include only vehicle sales reported in period.
22404030	c-Domestic car
22404031	d-Percentage change is greater than 999%.

22405001	Antonio L. Savoca, 66 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of the Atlantic Research Corp. subsidiary.
22405002	Mr. Savoca had been a consultant to the subsidiary's rocket-propulsion operations.
22405003	Mr. Savoca succeeds William H. Borten, who resigned to pursue personal interests.
22405004	Sequa makes and repairs jet engines.
22405005	It also has interests in military electronics and electro-optics, marine transportation and machinery used to make food and beverage cans.
22406001	It wasn't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U.S. Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists, imperialists and spies.
22406002	Now, the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital.
22406003	Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign: "Szabad Europa Radio" -- Radio Free Europe.
22406004	"I think this is a victory for the radio," says Barnabas de Bueky, a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich, West Germany, headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service.
22406005	In fact, the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it.
22406006	But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network's life in more ways than one.
22406007	In fact, Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success.
22406008	While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest, so can others.
22406009	In addition, competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled.
22406010	Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism, Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame, even boring.
22406011	"They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio," says Andrew Deak, a computer-science student at the Technical University in Budapest.
22406012	"The Hungarian {radio} reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what's going on here."
22406013	Indeed, Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion.
22406014	Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe.
22406015	Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines.
22406016	Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder.
22406017	The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves, though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian.
22406018	Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50% stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers, while Britain's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves.
22406019	But Radio Free Europe doesn't plan to fade away.
22406020	With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way, the network's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the "Great Eastern Beyond."
22406021	Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union, Radio Liberty, say they won't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts.
22406022	They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues: from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz.
22406023	The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe.
22406024	Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters, the country's rulers were trying to look more hospitable.
22406025	It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office.
22406026	Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe's new location, but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing: "They found us four phone lines in central Budapest," says Geza Szocs, a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location.
22406027	"That is a miracle."
22406028	It's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network, which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents (who filed reports to the network by phone, secret messengers or letters).
22406029	In fact, some of the network's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the "Dark Ages of the 20th Century."
22406030	"During the past four years, many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios," says the writer.
22406031	"There were some very brave broadcasts."
22406032	The listeners, too, had to be brave.
22406033	Through much of the post-World War II period, listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary.
22406034	"When we listen to the Europe station, my mother still gets nervous," says a Budapest translator.
22406035	"She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains."
22406036	Now, the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late-night slot.
22406037	Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight.
22406038	Television, which most of the time is considered rather tame, has entered the running with a new program, "The End of the Day," which comes on after 11 p.m.
22406039	It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs.
22406040	Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for "Sunday Journal," on Hungarian Radio.
22406041	The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe, which is trying to beef up programs.
22406042	The Budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east.
22406043	The Hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called Newsreel, with international and domestic news, plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world.
22406044	There's also a host of new programs, trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics.
22406045	A daily 35-minute program called "The March of Time" tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world.
22406046	There's a program for women and a science show.
22406047	And to attract younger listeners, Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups.
22406048	The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest.
22406049	"We are starving for all the news," says Mr. Deak, the student.
22406050	"Every moment we want to know everything about the world.
22407001	Proposals for government-operated "national service," like influenza, flare up from time to time, depress the resistance of the body politic, run their course, and seem to disappear, only to mutate and afflict public life anew.
22407002	The disease metaphor comes to mind, of course, not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service.
22407003	Rather, it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s, along with smallpox.
22407004	It is back with us again, in the form of legislation to pay volunteers under a "National and Community Service Act," a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall.
22407005	Why does the national-service virus keep coming back?
22407006	Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel.
22407007	If only we could get America's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving.
22407008	A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted as a way of curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by, of all things, expanding the draft.
22407009	Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers, despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion.
22407010	Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to doom national service as much as the draft.
22407011	But the virus was kept alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago, when it again was let loose.
22407012	This time it attempted to invade two connected problems, the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans.
22407013	Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants, the advocates reasoned, but require some form of service from each recipient?
22407014	Military service, moreover, could be a national-service option.
22407015	Thus, undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious, infecting patriotic conservatives, pay-as-you-go moderates, and idealistic liberals.
22407016	The Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group sponsoring the plan, surely thought it might help the party to attract support, especially among college students and their parents.
22407017	A provision allowing grants to be applied to first-home purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of schooling.
22407018	The DLC plan envisaged "volunteers" planting trees, emptying bedpans, tutoring children, and assisting librarians for $100 a week, tax free, plus medical care.
22407019	With a tax-free $10,000 voucher payment at the end of each year, the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $17,500 a year.
22407020	Mind you, most of "the volunteers" would be unskilled 17- to 18-year-olds, some not even high school graduates, and many saving money by living at home.
22407021	They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families.
22407022	As it happened, political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system, so the national-service devotees decided to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of "give in order to get."
22407023	Opposition to national service from the Pentagon, which wants to protect its own recruitment process, also led to the military-service option being dropped.
22407024	Clearly, a new rationale for national service had to be cooked up.
22407025	What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy's Labor Committee, that great stove of government expansionism, where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine?
22407026	In this case, the new recipe for national service called for throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle: a demonstration project for educational aid (particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn), a similar demonstration program for youth conservation (a la Sen. Chris Dodd), a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects (a Kennedy specialty), a community service work-study program for students (pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers, among others), plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion programs.
22407027	Before the menu is printed, the House may add more ingredients, also changing the initial price, now posted at some $330 million.
22407028	It is widely known that "too many cooks spoil the broth," but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks, especially if they are senators.
22407029	The "omnibus" bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop, but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard.
22407030	The aroma of patronage is in the air.
22407031	Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance?
22407032	On the contrary, it is as robust as ever.
22407033	According to the Gallup Poll, American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service, while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30% (adjusted for inflation).
22407034	Even if government does see various "unmet needs," national service is not the way to meet them.
22407035	If we want to support students, we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more scholarships based on something called "scholarship," rather than on the government's idea of "service."
22407036	Or we might provide a tax credit for working students.
22407037	What we do not need to do is start a war, and then try to justify it by creating a GI Bill.
22407038	To the extent we lack manpower to staff menial jobs in hospitals, for example, we should raise pay, pursue labor-saving technology, or allow more legal immigration, rather than overpay high school graduates as short-term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs.
22407039	Will national service, in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal to get adopted?
22407040	Not necessarily.
22407041	Polls show wide, generalized support for some vague concept of service, but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing.
22407042	Nonetheless, Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting "associations," "societies" and "councils," some of which may hope to receive the paid "volunteers."
22407043	So far, the president seems ill-disposed to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free-standing proposal to endow a "Points of Light" foundation with $25 million to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism.
22407044	However, even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in "brokering" federal funds for volunteer projects.
22407045	There's no need for such concessions.
22407046	The omnibus can be defeated, the virus controlled, and real service protected.
22407047	National service, the utopian idea, still won't go away then, of course, but the millions of knee-socked youth performing works of "civic content" will be mobilized only in the imagination of their progenitors.

22407049	This article is adapted from remarks at a Hoover Institution conference on national service, in which Mr. Szanton also participated.
22408001	Drug Emporium Inc. said Gary Wilber, 39 years old, who had been president and chief operating officer for the past year, was named chief executive officer of this drugstore chain.
22408002	He succeeds his father, Philip T. Wilber, who founded the company and remains chairman.
22408003	Robert E. Lyons III, 39, who headed the company's Philadelphia region, was appointed president and chief operating officer, succeeding Gary Wilber.
22409001	American Physicians Service Group Inc. said it purchased about 42% of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $5 million from Texas American Energy Corp.
22409002	American Physicians said it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime's five-member board.
22409003	American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals.
22409004	Prime, based in Bedminster, N.J., provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers.
22409005	For the year ended June 30, Prime had a net loss of $3 million on sales of $13.8 million.
22410001	The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to 0.8% from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7%, the National Statistics Institute said.
22410002	The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3%.
22410003	If the economy continues to expand by 0.8% a quarter for the rest of the year, it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3%, the institute said.
22410004	That would be down from the 3.8% rise posted in 1988.
22411001	The Canadian government announced a new, 12-year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors 10.5% in the first year.
22411002	The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall, when details of a new series are released.
22411003	Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements.
22411004	The government has about 41.4 billion Canadian dollars (US$35.2 billion) of such bonds currently outstanding.
22411005	Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds, which may be redeemed any time at face value.
22411006	The bonds go on sale Oct. 19.
22412001	The debate over National Service has begun again.
22412002	After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high-school graduation, the focus has shifted to Washington.
22412003	At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring.
22412004	One, co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served.
22412005	An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), and including some diluted Nunn-McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell, Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd, has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee.
22412006	It might well win Senate passage.
22412007	President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service (YES) plan, though its details remain to be specified.
22412008	What is one to think of all this?
22412009	Doctrine and special interests govern some responses.
22412010	People eager to have youth "pay their dues to society" favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones.
22412011	So do those who seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights.
22412012	Then there are instinctive opponents.
22412013	To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money.
22412014	Devotees of the market question the value of the work national service would perform:
22412015	If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost.
22412016	Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want to see rights enlarged, not obligations.
22412017	But what about those of us whose views are not predetermined by formula or ideology?
22412018	How should we think about national service?
22412019	Let's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- "national service" has no agreed meaning.
22412020	Would service be voluntary or compulsory?
22412021	Short or long?
22412022	Part-time or full-time?
22412023	Paid or unpaid?
22412024	Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands?
22412025	What kinds of work would they do?
22412026	What does "national" mean?
22412027	Would the program be run by the federal government, by local governments, or by private voluntary organizations?
22412028	And who would serve?
22412029	Only males, as with the draft, or both sexes?
22412030	Youth only or all ages?
22412031	Middle-class people, or poor people, or a genuine cross-section?
22412032	Many or few?
22412033	Those are not trivial questions, and the label "national service" answers none of them.
22412034	Then how should we think about national service?
22412035	As a starting point, here are five propositions: 1. Consider the ingredients, not the name.
22412036	Ignore "national service" in the abstract; consider specific proposals.
22412037	They will differ in crucial ways.
22412038	2. "Service" should be service.
22412039	As commonly understood, service implies sacrifice.
22412040	It involves accepting risk, or giving up income, or deferring a career.
22412041	It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy, whose benefits to enrollees are worth some $17,500 a year, do not qualify.
22412042	There is a rationale for such bills: Federal subsidies to college students amount to "a GI Bill without the GI"; arguably those benefits should be earned, not given.
22412043	But the earnings exceed by 20% the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs.
22412044	Why call that service?
22412045	3. Encouragement is fine; compulsion is not.
22412046	Compelled service is unconstitutional.
22412047	It is also unwise and unenforceable.
22412048	(Who will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year?)
22412049	But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior.
22412050	It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages.
22412051	Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S., should build on the service programs already in existence, and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing.
22412052	4. Good programs are not cheap.
22412053	Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply: forest fires fought, housing rehabilitated, students tutored, day-care centers staffed.
22412054	There is important work to be done, and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply.
22412055	Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision -- all of high quality.
22412056	They involve stipends to participants.
22412057	Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale.
22412058	Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 a year.
22412059	Are they worth that?
22412060	Evaluations suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted.
22412061	But the calculations are challengeable.
22412062	5. Underclass youth are a special concern.
22412063	Are such expenditures worthwhile, then?
22412064	Yes, if targeted.
22412065	People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve, but there are many ways for middle-class kids, and their elders, to serve at little public cost.
22412066	They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions, or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers.
22412067	Underclass youth don't have those opportunities.
22412068	They are not enrolled in high school or college.
22412069	They are unlikely to be employed.
22412070	And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances, among family structures breaking down, surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects.
22412071	But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented by productive and disciplined service.
22412072	Some won't accept the discipline; others drop out for other reasons.
22412073	But some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed.
22412074	Learning skills, producing something cooperatively, feeling useful, they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them.
22412075	Even if it is cheaper to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals, the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation.
22412076	Strictly speaking, these youth are not performing service.
22412077	They are giving up no income, deferring no careers, incurring no risk.
22412078	But they believe themselves to be serving, and they begin to respect themselves (and others), to take control of their lives, to think of the future.
22412079	That is a service to the nation.
22412080	It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve.
22412081	Mr. Szanton, a Carter administration budget official, heads his own Washington-based strategic planning firm.
22412082	He is a co-author of "National Service: What Would It Mean?"
22412083	(Lexington Books, 1986).
22413001	Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet.
22413002	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis.
22413003	And at the Treasury, Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge.
22413004	But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters.
22413005	In addition, officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday's market drop turn into this morning's rout.
22413006	"The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis," said one government official, insisting on anonymity.
22413007	The Fed's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled Sunday morning, when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning.
22413008	Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories, according to knowledgeable sources, and insisted he hadn't authorized any public comment.
22413009	Nevertheless, Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank's game plan.
22413010	It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987, providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system afloat.
22413011	The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions.
22413012	The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC's "This Week."
22413013	"Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact.
22413014	I'm sure they'll do what's right, what's prudent, what's sensible," he said.
22413015	When it was suggested his comment was a "non-answer," Mr. Darman replied: "It is a non-answer.
22413016	But, in this context, that's the smart thing to do."
22413017	At the Treasury, Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market's drop.
22413018	"Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy," he said.
22413019	"The economy remains well-balanced, and the outlook is for continued moderate growth."
22413020	But administration officials conceded that Friday's drop carried the chance of further declines this week.
22413021	"One possibility is that this is a surgical setback, reasonably limited in its breadth, and not a major problem," said one senior administration official, who also asked that he not be named.
22413022	"The other is that we see another major disaster, like two years ago.
22413023	I think that's less likely."
22413024	Nevertheless, Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening, monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world.
22413025	The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe.
22413026	Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments.
22413027	In Tokyo, share prices dropped sharply by 1.7% in early Monday morning trading.
22413028	After the initial slide, the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower.
22413029	In the Bush administration, the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady, Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins.
22413030	The three men worked together on the so-called Brady Commission, headed by Mr. Brady, which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market's collapse.
22413031	As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets, and financial market crises.
22413032	Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market's decline began.
22413033	He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins, who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges.
22413034	Later, Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas.
22413035	Aides say he continued to work the phones through the weekend.
22413036	Administration officials say President Bush was briefed throughout Friday afternoon and evening, even after leaving for Camp David.
22413037	He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin, chairman of the counsel of economic advisers.
22413038	Government officials tried throughout the weekend to render a business-as-usual appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic.
22413039	Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford, for instance, was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs, Va., when the stock market fell, and remained there through the following day.
22413040	And as of last night, Fed Chairman Greenspan hadn't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning.
22413041	Ironically, Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20, 1987.
22413042	He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19, when the market plummeted 508 points, but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech.
22414001	Following is a weekly listing of unadited net asset values of publicly traded investment fund shares, reported by the companies as of Friday's close.
22414002	Also shown is the closing listed market price or a dealer-to-dealer asked price of each fund's shares, with the percentage of difference.
22414003	b-As of Thursday's close.
22414004	c-Translated at Commercial Rand exchange rate.
22414005	e-In Canadian dollars.
22414006	f-As of Wednesday's close.
22414007	g-10.06.89 NAV:22.15.
22414008	z-Not available.
22415001	Put down that phone.
22415002	Walk around the room; take two deep breaths.
22415003	Resist the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks.
22415004	That's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
22415005	No one can say for sure what will happen today.
22415006	And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months.
22415007	But they're nearly unanimous on one point: Don't sell into a panic.
22415008	Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it.
22415009	Even after Friday's plunge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48% above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago.
22415010	Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past.
22415011	The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began.
22415012	The "October massacres" of 1978 and 1979 were scary, but didn't lead to severe or sustained downturns.
22415013	Indeed, some pros see Friday's plunge, plus any further damage that might occur early this week, as a chance for bargain hunting.
22415014	"There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you've got the cash," says Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
22415015	But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand pat.
22415016	"When you see a runaway train," says Steve Janachowski, partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski, "you wait for the train to stop."
22415017	Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do -- the advice is: Wait for the market to bounce back, and sell shares gradually during rallies.
22415018	The best thing individual investors can do is "just sit tight," says Marshall B. Front, executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $18 billion.
22415019	On the one hand, Mr. Front says, it would be misguided to sell into "a classic panic."
22415020	On the other hand, it's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy.
22415021	"This is all emotion right now, and when emotion starts to run, it can run further than anyone anticipates," he said.
22415022	"So it's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize."
22415023	Roger Ibbotson, professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Inc., says, "My real advice would be to just ride through it.
22415024	Generally, it isn't wise to be in and out" of the stock market.
22415025	Mr. Ibbotson thinks that this week is "going to be a roller-coaster week."
22415026	But he also thinks it is "a good week to consider buying."
22415027	John Snyder, former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp., an organization of investment clubs and individual investors, says his fellow club members didn't sell in the crash of 1987, and see no reason to sell now.
22415028	"We're dedicated long-term investors, not traders," he says.
22415029	"We understand panics and euphoria.
22415030	And we hope to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge."
22415031	One camp of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity.
22415032	Over the next days and weeks, they say, investors should look for stocks to buy.
22415033	Friday's action "was an old-fashioned panic," says Alfred Goldman, director of technical market analysis for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
22415034	"Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price."
22415035	His advice: "You ought to be there with a basket catching them."
22415036	James Craig, portfolio manager for the Denver-based Janus Fund, which has one of the industry's better track records, started his buying during Friday's plunge.
22415037	Stocks such as Hershey Foods Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he couldn't resist them, he says.
22415038	And Mr. Craig expects to pick up more shares today.
22415039	"It will be chaotic at first, but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble," he says.
22415040	He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now, and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987.
22415041	Mr. Front of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should "concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side, or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction."
22415042	His firm favors selected computer, drug and pollution-control stocks.
22415043	Other investment pros are more pessimistic.
22415044	They say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away.
22415045	Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly, gradual, and done when stock prices are rallying.
22415046	On Thursday, William Fleckenstein, a Seattle money manager, used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline.
22415047	He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5% to 6%, far higher than most people suppose.
22415048	In the pension accounts he manages, Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks, partly as an inflation hedge.
22415049	He thinks government officials are terrified to let a recession start when government, corporate and personal debt levels are so high.
22415050	So he thinks the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation.
22415051	As a result, Mr. Fleckenstein says, "I think the ball game's over," and investors are about to face a bear market.
22415052	David M. Jones, vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., recommends Treasury securities (of up to five years' maturity).
22415053	He says the Oct. 6 employment report, showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector, is a warning sign to investors.
22415054	One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy "put" options, either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index.
22415055	A put option gives its holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell a stock (or stock index) for a specified price (the strike price) until the option expires.
22415056	Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option.
22415057	The cost, or premium, tends to get fat in times of crisis.
22415058	Thus, buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk.
22415059	The prices of puts generally didn't soar Friday.
22415060	For example, the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3% at Thursday's close to only 3.3% at Friday's close, even though the shares dropped more than $5.50.
22415061	But put-option prices may zoom when trading resumes today.
22415062	It's hard to generalize about a reasonable price for puts.
22415063	But investors should keep in mind, before paying too much, that the average annual return for stock holdings, long-term, is 9% to 10% a year; a return of 15% is considered praiseworthy.
22415064	Paying, say, 10% for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return.
22415065	James A. White and Tom Herman contributed to this article.
22416001	Coldwell Banker Commercial Group said it sold $47 million of common stock to its employees at $10 a share, giving them a total stake of more than 40% in the commercial real estate brokerage firm.
22416002	The firm, which was acquired in April from Sears, Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out, had planned to sell up to $56.4 million of stock, or a 50% stake in the company, to its 5,000 employees.
22416003	Though the offering didn't sell out, James J. Didion, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We're pretty proud of the employees' response."
22416004	He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan, where a company usually borrows money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time, here employees had to fork out their own cash for the stock.
22416005	"They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money," Mr. Didion said.
22416006	"It's totally different."
22416007	He said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees.
22416008	"We're in a service business, and in that context, it's vital to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success."
22416009	The brokerage firm won't pay a dividend on the stock.
22416010	Employees have the right to trade stock among themselves, and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions.
22416011	They may also eventually sell the shares to third parties, but the outside investors who own the remaining 60% of Coldwell Banker have the right to first refusal.
22416012	Those outside investors in Coldwell Banker include Carlyle Group, a closely held Washington, D.C., merchant banking firm whose co-chairman is Frank Carlucci, former secretary of defense; Frederic V. Malek, senior adviser to Carlyle Group; Mellon Family Trust of Pittsburgh; Westinghouse Credit Corp., the financial services unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.; Bankers Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp.; and a group of Japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of Tokyo-based Sumitomo Bank.
22416013	Bankers Trust and Sumitomo financed the $300 million acquisition from Sears Roebuck.
22416014	Coldwell Banker also named three outside director nominees for its 17 member board.
22416015	The nominees are Gary Wilson, chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co.; James Montgomery, chief executive officer of Great Western Financial Corp.; and Peter Ubberroth, former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor.
22417001	The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
22417002	Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash, trading in the Merc's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday's close, a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
22417003	The aim of the interruption would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, which would be hammered by such a volatile move on the Merc.
22417004	That early-morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted after the 1987 crash.
22417005	The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge surges in trading volume.
22417006	Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday's one-hour collapse and worked as expected, even though they didn't prevent a stunning plunge.
22417007	But the major "circuit breakers" have yet to be evaluated.
22417008	A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test.
22417009	A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other, more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash.
22417010	Most notably, several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force, which analyzed the 1987 crash, would be revived -- especially because that group's chairman is now the Treasury secretary.
22417011	The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions, such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets.
22417012	But for the moment, attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place, and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended.
22417013	Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc's Standard & Poor's 500 contract, as well as "hot-line" communications among exchanges.
22417014	Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels.
22417015	During the first halt, after the S&P index had fallen 12 points, the Big Board's "Sidecar" computer program automatically was triggered.
22417016	That system is designed to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks.
22417017	One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school.
22417018	"You don't want the fire but you know what to do," said Howard Dubnow, an independent floor broker and a Merc governor.
22417019	"There was no panic.
22417020	The system worked the way we devised it to work."
22417021	After reopening for about 15 minutes, the S&P index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went into effect.
22417022	Traders then spent the last half-hour "watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points," Mr. Dubnow added, referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour.
22417023	One observer estimated that 80% to 90% of the S&P traders "were just standing around watching."
22417024	But the 250-point circuit breaker never had to kick in, and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade's Major Market Index also weren't triggered.
22417025	The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies.
22417026	The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash.
22417027	The process of post-crash reforms began with calls to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments.
22417028	In October 1987, just after the market drop, Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated.
22417029	Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled down to a series of steps to soften big stock drops by interrupting trading to give market players time to pause and reconsider positions.
22417030	In addition, limits were placed on computer-driven trading, and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets.
22417031	Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated.
22417032	At the outset the prime target was program trading, which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill.
22417033	There were also calls to strip the stock markets of "derivative" products, such as stock-index futures and options, which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin, for example, likened to "barnacles attached to the basic market."
22417034	And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange's system of having stock trades flow through specialists, or market makers.
22417035	When the Brady Task Force's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988, it immediately reshaped the reformers' agenda.
22417036	Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one, and concluding that the crash had "raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown," the presidential task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets, to make margins consistent across markets, to unify clearing systems and to install circuit breakers.
22417037	Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented.
22417038	The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies.
22417039	In May 1988, the Working Group, made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finally endorsed only circuit breakers.
22417040	After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets, circuit breakers were set in place, with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
22417041	Privately, some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists.
22417042	After all, this free-market argument went, the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century.
22417043	"Circuit breakers" set to soften big drops:
22417044	-- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening, contract trading pauses for 10 minutes.
22417045	-- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening, contract trading pauses for 10 minutes.
22417046	-- If S&P futures fall 12 points (equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA), trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher.
22417047	On NYSE program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders.
22417048	-- If S&P futures fall 30 points, trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher.
22417049	-- If Dow Industrials fall 250 points, trading on the Big Board halts for an hour.
22417050	S&P and MMI contracts also halt.
22417051	-- If DJIA drops 400 points, Big Board halts trading for two hours.
22417052	Trading in MMI and S&P futures also halted.
22417053	Brady Task Force recommendations (Jan. 1988):
22417054	-- Establish an overarching regulator for financial markets
22417055	-- Unify trade-clearing systems
22417056	-- Make margins consistent across stock and futures markets
22417057	SEC proposals (May 1988):
22417058	-- Require prompt reports of large securities trades.
22417059	-- Give SEC authority to monitor risk-taking by affiliates of brokerage firms.
22417060	-- Transfer jurisdiction over stock-related futures to SEC from CFTC.
22417061	(Opposed by new SEC chairman)
22417062	-- Give SEC authority to halt securities trading, (also opposed by new SEC chairman).
22417063	Congressional proposal:
22417064	-- Create a task force to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws.
22417065	Breaking the Soviet government's television monopoly, an independent company has gained rights to show world programming, including American films.
22417066	"There must not be a monopoly, there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers," Nikolai I. Lutsenko, the president of the Nika TV company, told the weekly newspaper Nedelya.
22417067	The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about a year, the newspaper said.
22417068	Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. to pick up the rights to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union.
22417069	Nedelya's article was accompanied by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado.
22417070	Even though it will be independent of official television, Nika will have an oversight board that will include members of the Communist youth league.
22417071	South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
22417072	De Beers said that workers at five of the group's mines were on strike, which it said was peaceful, with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines.
22417073	The deadlock in negotiations occurred with De Beers offering a 17% increase in the minimum-wage category while the union demanded a 37.6% increase in the minimum wage.
22417074	Japan's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been bribed by pinball-parlor owners.
22417075	The allegation had been raised in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese-style pinball, called pachinko, had infiltrated politics.
22417076	Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Socialist Party, acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen (about $55,000) but said the donations were legal and none of its members acted to favor the industry.
22417077	The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain, Argentina, Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders.
22417078	A report by the conservation group presented at the U.N.-sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids.
22417079	Fund official Simon Lyster said world trade in wildlife was estimated to total $5 billion of business annually.
22417080	A NATO project to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed by the pull-out of three of its eight participating nations.
22417081	Britain, France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing, but some officials pointed to growing reluctance among the allies to commit themselves to big defense spending while East-West disarmament talks show signs of success.
22417082	Small wonder that Britain's Labor Party wants credit controls.
22417083	A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month, the Tories raised the nation's base interest rate.
22417084	Labor's Visa card is believed to be the first linked to a British political party.
22417085	Labor gets 25 pence (39 cents) for every 100 (about $155) that a user charges to the card.
22417086	As with other plastic in Britain's high-interest-rate environment, the Labor card, administered by Co-operative Bank, carries a stiff (in this case, 29.8%) annual rate on the unpaid balance.
22417087	China's year-long austerity program has achieved some successes in harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets.
22417088	The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods haven't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down.
22417089	The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ($270 million) was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies.
22417090	The newspaper quoted experts as saying the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to "become very unreasonable" and reduce needed funds for investment in the "already difficult state budget."
22417091	The aim of the austerity measures was to slice economic growth, which soared to 20.7% last year, to 8% in 1990.
22417092	Economists now predict the growth rate will be about 11.5% for the year.
22417093	In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion, Russian Orthodox priests were allowed to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Moscow patriarchate in the Kremlin's 15th-century Uspensky Cathedral, where czars were crowned. . . .
22417094	A 34-foot-tall, $7.7 million statue of Buddha was completed on a hill outside Hong Kong, facing China.
22417095	The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan, director of the Po Lin Monastery, who said: "Hong Kong is such a prosperous place, we also need some kind of religious symbol.
22418001	It all seemed innocent enough: Last April, one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here, identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company's new cassette players for children.
22418002	"It is almost identical to the Sony product," Mr. Iken remarked, after seeing prototypes and pictures.
22418003	Replied a Justin salesman: "Exactly."
22418004	The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40% below those of Sony Corp. of Japan's "My First Sony" line.
22418005	The visitor waxed enthusiastic and promised to return.
22418006	But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped-for bonanza from underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass.
22418007	Mr. Iken, it turned out, was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder to gather information for Sony.
22418008	His recording later turned up as a court exhibit.
22418009	Seeking to keep Justin's "My Own" product line off the U.S. market, Sony last May filed a suit in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement, unfair competition and other violations of business law.
22418010	Since then, life has changed a lot for 61-year-old Leonard Kaye, Justin's owner.
22418011	"I haven't been able to get a decent night's sleep since this has been going on," he says.
22418012	"It's the most distracting thing in my life -- I can't even attend to my business."
22418013	His company (annual sales: about $25 million) may suffer a costly blow -- losing an estimated 10% of total sales -- if Sony (annual sales: about $16 billion) prevails.
22418014	Justin's plight shows what can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational.
22418015	With considerable irony, the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business.
22418016	Americans used to complain bitterly about being undersold by look-alike products from Japan.
22418017	Now Sony, whose innovative, premium-priced products are among the most admired in consumer electronics, is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look-alike produced in China.
22418018	"The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants to stop it," says Lewis H. Eslinger, Sony's attorney, who previously guarded Rubik's Cube.
22418019	(Sony itself declines to comment.)
22418020	If Sony wins, Mr. Eslinger says, its little rival will have to try to sell the products overseas.
22418021	At worst, he adds, "They'd have to grind them all up and throw them away."
22418022	Mr. Kaye denies the suit's charges and says his only mistake was taking on Sony in the marketplace.
22418023	"I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper," he says.
22418024	Today, U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected to rule on Sony's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products, on which deliveries began in July.
22418025	The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments.
22418026	Though hoping to settle the case, Justin vows to fight on, if necessary.
22418027	But the battle is more than Justin bargained for.
22418028	"I had no idea I was getting in so deep," says Mr. Kaye, who founded Justin in 1982.
22418029	Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc., a Taiwan electronics maker, and retired, only to find he was bored.
22418030	With Justin, he began selling toys and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong, beginning with Mickey Mouse radios.
22418031	The company has grown -- to about 40 employees, from four initially, Mr. Kaye says.
22418032	Justin has been profitable since 1986, adds the official, who shares his office with numerous teddy bears, all samples from his line of plush toys.
22418033	Like many others, Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony, in a classic example of market segmentation, changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children.
22418034	The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models.
22418035	(In court papers, Sony says it has spent more than $3 million to promote the line, with resulting sales of over a million units.)
22418036	Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor.
22418037	His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color.
22418038	Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors.
22418039	("To be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire-engine red," says Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney.)
22418040	By last winter, Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed.
22418041	Indeed, concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin's customers, Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April.
22418042	He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department.
22418043	But Justin hasn't pursued those charges (which were without merit, according to Mr. Eslinger, the Sony attorney).
22418044	Recalls Mr. Baxley: "Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone.
22418045	We never intended taking on Sony -- we don't have the resources."
22418046	Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit.
22418047	Off and on since then, the companies have skirmished in court.
22418048	And Justin, in a news release, says, "Once competitive, Sony now resorts to strong-arm tactics in American courtrooms to carve out and protect niche markets."
22418049	Sony's lawyer insists that the company's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters.
22418050	He also insists that Sony, no less than others, has a legal right to protect its "trade dress," in this case, mostly the colors that it claims make My First Sony products distinctive.
22418051	(Justin claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children's market.)
22418052	Whatever its merits, Sony's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin.
22418053	It's also costly.
22418054	Mr. Kaye says he has paid more than $70,000 in legal fees so far.
22418055	Of Sony, Mr. Kaye says: "They know there's no way for them to lose.
22418056	They just keep digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away."
22418057	For now, though, he vows to hang in.
22419001	@ Charles H. Tenney II, chairman of Unitil Corp., purchased 34,602 shares, or 4.9%, of Unitil's common, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
22419002	The stock was bought on Thursday in a privately negotiated transaction, the filing said.
22419003	As previously reported, Unitil, Exeter, N.H., and Fitchburg Gas & Electric Co., Fitchburg, Mass., are targets of unsolicited tender offers from Boston-based Eastern Utilities Associates.
22419004	Eastern Utilities has offered $40 a share for Unitil and $36 a share for Fitchburg Gas and has extended both offers to Dec. 4.
22419005	Both companies rejected the offers.
22420001	Dresdner Bank AG of West Germany has announced a friendly tender offer for control of Banque Internationale de Placements, a French bank whose main shareholder is France's Societe Generale, the Societe de Bourses Francaises said.
22420002	The tender offer by West Germany's second-biggest commercial bank is in two stages.
22420003	Dresdner is offering to acquire 32.99% of BIP's capital for 1,015 francs ($156.82) a share.
22420004	The terms of the offer put a value of 528 million francs ($81.6 million) on the 32.99% shareholding.
22420005	The Societe Generale banking group controls 18.2% of the shareholding, while Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. owns 9.69% and Financiere Tradition, a holding company, owns 5.1%.
22421001	Mexican investor Joel Rocha Garza said he sold a block of 600,000 shares of Smith Laboratories Inc. common stock to companies affiliated with him.
22421002	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Rocha Garza said Biscayne Syndicate Inc., Lahus II Inc., and Lahus III Inc. bought the 600,000 shares on Oct. 11 for $1.4 million, or $2.375 a share.
22421003	Mr. Rocha Garza said that he, Clarendon Group Ltd., Biscayne, Lahus II, and Lahus III are all affiliated and hold a combined stake of 1,234,100 shares, or 9.33%.
22421004	Mr. Rocha Garza has said he wants to purchase more shares.
22421005	In San Diego, Smith Laboratories President Timothy Wollaeger said the transfer of the shares isn't significant.
22422001	Investcorp, New York, said it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10-store Sports Unlimited chain for some $40 million.
22422002	The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation, a 10-year-old sporting goods retailer, said Oliver E. Richardson, a member of Investcorp's management committee and a director of the chain.
22422003	Sports Unlimited, Tampa, Fla., posted revenue of $59 million for the year ended July 31.
22422004	The company is "very profitable" on an operating basis, Mr. Richardson said, but he declined to specify numbers.
22422005	In 1982, Sports & Recreation's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie, Ill.
22422006	In the latest transaction, management bought out the passive investors' holding, Mr. Richardson said.
22423001	Hammond Co., Newport Beach, Calif., said Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement, under which it won't purchase any more of the mortgage banker's common stock, through Oct. 31.
22423002	The previous agreement expired Thursday.
22423003	Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity, an Irvine, Calif., title-insurance underwriter, are continuing, but that prospects for a longer-term standstill agreement are uncertain.
22423004	Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to 23.57% in recent months.
22423005	Statements made in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond to request a standstill agreement.
22424001	Giant Group Ltd. said it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways, a Denver-based regional carrier that operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
22424002	Giant, a Beverly Hills, Calif., collection of companies that is controlled by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, didn't give a reason for halting its plan to acquire the airline, and Aspen officials couldn't be reached for comment.
22424003	Giant agreed last month to purchase the carrier.
22424004	Giant hasn't ever disclosed the proposed price, although Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based aircraft consulting concern, has valued Aspen's fleet at about $46 million.
22424005	The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies, which are involved in making cement, recycling newsprint and operating fast-food restaurants.
22425001	The state-controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said it has obtained regulatory approval to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10% from the current level of about 8%.
22425002	Friday's approval was needed to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given Wednesday to Cie. Financiere de Paribas.
22425003	Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed "investment purposes," although the issue has been surrounded by takeover speculation in recent weeks.
22425004	AGF didn't comment officially on its reasons for seeking the approval, but people close to the group said it was done to make sure the group would have the flexibility to increase its stake in the future, should interesting price opportunities arise.
22425005	An AGF official did specify, however, that there was no foundation to recent rumors the group might be acting in concert with Paribas.
22426001	Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., said it agreed to join with Aermacchi S.p.A. of Varese, Italy, to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force.
22426002	The Air Force is looking to buy 540 new primary jet trainers, with a total value of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, between 1994 and 2004.
22426003	The aircraft would replace the T-37, made by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp., which the Air Force uses to train jet pilots.
22426004	Lockheed said the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft to replace its T34C trainers made by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp.
22426005	Under the agreement with Lockheed, Aermacchi will license Lockheed to build the Aermacchi MB-339 jet tandem-trainer and will supply certain structures.
22426006	Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem-seat trainer at its Marietta, Ga., plant should the Air Force order the craft.
22426007	A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank, Calif., said he wasn't aware of which other companies would be competing for the Air Force contract.
22427001	Striking auto workers ended their 19-day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital.
22427002	But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government's ability to pay its bills.
22427003	The Peugeot metalworkers began filing out of the shop, which makes auto parts, at the plant in Mulhouse after voting 589 to 193 to abandon the occupation.
22427004	Their withdrawal was based on promises by Peugeot to open negotiations in Paris at the same time the last man left the premises.
22427005	The strike by customs officers, tax collectors, treasury workers and other civil servants attached to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman.
22427006	Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid because of a complex job-rating system they say fails to take into account their education and level of technical expertise.
22428001	The market for $200 billion of high-risk junk bonds, battered by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year, practically vanished Friday.
22428002	Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds, only to find themselves deserted by potential buyers.
22428003	Stunned, they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades.
22428004	"The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids, only offers," says independent investor Martin D. Sass, who manages nearly $4 billion and who recently decided to buy distressed securities for a new fund.
22428005	This calamity is "far from over," he says.
22428006	Junk's collapse helped stoke the panicky selling of stocks that produced the deepest one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19, 1987, crash.
22428007	Simultaneously, it also helped trigger this year's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the highest-quality securities they could find.
22428008	But "an eerie silence pervaded" the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite "no active trading," says John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
22428009	For example, the price of Southland Corp.'s $500 million of 16 3/4% bonds due 2002 -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman, Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25% to just 30 cents on the dollar.
22428010	But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland, the owner of the nationwide chain of 7-11 convenience stores that is strapped for cash.
22428011	Goldman officials declined to comment.
22428012	Junk bonds, which mushroomed from less than $2 billion at the start of this decade, have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments.
22428013	The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing.
22428014	Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up for sale.
22428015	Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that are counting on at least $7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat, may never get the money.
22428016	"The music has stopped playing," says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins.
22428017	"You've either got a chair or you don't."
22428018	In Friday's aftermath, says R. Douglas Carleton, a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp., "much of the $7 billion forward calendar could be deferred, depending on the hysteria."
22428019	In August, First Boston withdrew a $475 million junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were "very skittish."
22428020	The outlook "looks shaky because we're still waiting" for mutual funds, in particular, to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors, says King Penniman, senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services.
22428021	Indeed, a Moody's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday.
22428022	In a stark contrast, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points, or about $25 for each $1,000 face amount, to 103 12/32, its biggest gain of the year.
22428023	The bond's yield dropped to 7.82%, the lowest since March 31, 1987, according to Technical Data Global Markets Group.
22428024	The yield on three-month Treasury bills, considered the safest of all investments, plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16%, the largest one-day decline since 1982.
22428025	The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
22428026	"When you get panic in one market, you get flight to quality in the other," said Maria Ramirez, money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
22428027	Nevertheless, the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead.
22428028	"This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook," says William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York.
22428029	Any sustained credit-easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities.
22428030	Robert Dow, a partner and portfolio manager at Lord, Abbett & Co., which manages $4 billion of high-yield bonds, says he doesn't "think there is any fundamental economic rationale {for the junk bond rout}.
22428031	It was herd instinct."
22428032	He adds: "The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed that means the economy will be terrible and that's bad for junk.
22428033	I don't believe that's the case, but I believe that people are running scared.
22428034	There is a flight to quality, and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it's in Treasurys."
22428035	Even as trading in high-yield issues dried up over the past month, corporations sold more than $2 billion of new junk bonds.
22428036	For example, a recent $375 million offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed.
22428037	A $550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. high-yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $50 million because of strong demand.
22428038	First Boston estimates that in November and December alone, junk bond investors will receive $4.8 billion of coupon interest payments.
22428039	"That's a clear indication that there is and will be an undercurrent of basic business going on," says Mr. Carleton of First Boston.
22428040	"I don't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $1.5 billion of orders for $550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner," says Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co.
22428041	"When the rally comes, insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will.
22428042	There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy well-structured deals; it's the stuff that's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of."
22428043	But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have multiplied this year, casting a pall over much of the junk market.
22428044	Michael McNamara, director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services, says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer, contributing to the slide in prices.
22428045	"Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals," he says.
22428046	"This year, at best, it's in one in every five or six.
22428047	And our credit standards haven't changed one iota."
22428048	However, Mr. McNamara said the slide in junk is creating "one hell of a buying opportunity" for selective buyers.
22428049	For the moment, investors seem more preoccupied with the "bad" junk than the "good" junk.
22428050	"The market has been weak since" the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York, says Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch.
22428051	"That really affected the market in that people started to ask 'What else is in trouble?'"
22428052	Well before Campeau, though, there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever.
22428053	Despite the relatively strong economy, junk bond prices did nothing except go down, hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news:
22428054	-- In June, two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $1.2 billion of speculative debt securities, New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money.
22428055	-- In July, Southmark Corp., the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $1.3 billion of junk bonds, voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law.
22428056	-- By the end of July, the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points.
22428057	-- In August, Resorts International Inc., which sold more than $500 million of junk bonds, suspended interest payments.
22428058	-- In September, just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau, Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $1.2 billion of debt securities.
22428059	Meantime, regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of abating.
22428060	Moody's says the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982.
22428061	In addition, there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
22428062	"The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it," says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, an early critic of the junk bond market.
22428063	"What we've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying exorbitant compound interest.
22428064	Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings.
22428065	What we're seeing now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative-grade debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy."
22428066	Friday's Market Activity
22428067	Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market.
22428068	The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. EDT at 103 12/32, compared with 100 27/32 Thursday, up 2 1/2 points.
22428069	The yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82%, the lowest since March 31, 1987, according to Technical Data Global Markets Group.
22428070	The "flight to quality" began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market.
22428071	Treasurys opened lower, reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September.
22428072	Bond prices barely budged until midday.
22428073	Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve, which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession.
22428074	Prices of municipals, investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose, but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts.
22428075	Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading, with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9% coupon securities, the most liquid mortgage issue.
22428076	The Ginnie Mae November 9% issue ended at 98 25/32, up 7/8 point on the day, to yield about 9.28% to a 12-year average life assumption.
22428077	Investment-grade corporate bonds were up about 1/2 to 3/4 point.
22428078	But the yield spread between lower-quality, investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened.
22428079	And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week's $3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
22428080	Despite rumors that the TVA's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets, sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled.
22428081	One of the sources said the smaller portions of $750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been "substantially oversubscribed."
22428082	Municipal bonds rose as much as 3/4 point.
22428083	Roger Lowenstein contributed to this article.
22429001	Friday's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash, and mechanisms have been put in place to keep markets more orderly.
22429002	Still, the lesson is about the same: On Friday the 13th, the market was spooked by Washington.
22429003	The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover, and it's certainly true the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt.
22429004	Still, the consensus seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business.
22429005	This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn: the success of Senate Democrats in stalling the capital gains tax cut.
22429006	The real value of all shares, after all, is directly impacted by the tax on any profits (all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not "ordinary income").
22429007	And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month.
22429008	An hour before Friday's plunge, that provision was stripped from the tax bill, leaving it with $5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut.
22429009	There is a great deal to be said, to be sure, for stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill.
22429010	It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery.
22429011	For one thing, no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote.
22429012	Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens, promises of a cleaner bill are suspect.
22429013	Especially so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama fiasco.
22429014	To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge, they are another instance of Washington's sticky fingers.
22429015	As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted of course, at some point the market will start to reject them.
22429016	But the airlines are scarcely a clear case, given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner, who professes to believe safety will be compromised if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes.
22429017	Worse, Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon.
22429018	James Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids.
22429019	It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to "review" any bid for 15% or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $1 billion or more.
22429020	So the UAL deal has problems, and the market loses 190 points.
22429021	Congratulations, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman.
22429022	In the 1987 crash, remember, the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal to tax takeovers out of existance.
22429023	Even more important, in our view, was the Treasury's threat to thrash the dollar.
22429024	The Treasury is doing the same thing today; thankfully, the dollar is not under 1987-style pressure.
22429025	Also, traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges.
22429026	They are better capitalized.
22429027	They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays.
22429028	The Fed promises any needed liquidity.
22429029	The Big Board's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved; it will be interesting to learn if "circuit breakers" prove to be a good idea.
22429030	In any event, some traders see stocks as underpriced today, unlike 1987.
22429031	There is nothing wrong with the market that can't be cured by a little coherence and common sense in Washington.
22429032	But on the bearish side, that may be too much to expect.
22430001	First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $23.3 million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans.
22430002	The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago, with $48 billion in assets, said it set aside $200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries.
22430003	The addition, on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves, brings the reserve to a level equaling 79% of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations.
22430004	First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $1.7 billion from $3 billion.
22430005	Despite this loss, First Chicago said it doesn't need to sell stock to raise capital.
22430006	During the quarter, the company realized a pretax gain of $60.4 million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit.
22430007	Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24% against last year's third quarter, to $38.2 million from $50.5 million.
22430008	Gains from First Chicago's venture capital unit, a big leveraged buy-out investor, rose 32% to $34 million from $25.7 million a year ago.
22430009	Interest income and most fee income was strong.
22431001	Greece's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5.
22431002	For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign: The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass.
22431003	In the mid-June round of voting, Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party.
22431004	The ad interim coalition government that emerged from post-electoral hagglings was, in essence, little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation: On one side, the center-right New Democracy Party, headed by Constantine Mitsotakis.
22431005	On the other, the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin, the Hellenic Left.
22431006	The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain: PASOK (Mr. Papandreou's party) as common political enemy.
22431007	The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption, purportedly at all levels, but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates.
22431008	In point of fact, this catharsis was overdue by decades.
22431009	When reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges, however, the notion transmogrified into a promised assault, with targets primarily for political gains, not justice.
22431010	With regard to Greece's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal, Mr. Papandreou's principal accuser remains George Koskotas, former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in Salem, Mass., from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece.
22431011	Mr. Koskotas's credibility is, at best, problematic.
22431012	He has ample motive to shift the blame, and his testimony has also been found less than forthright on numerous points.
22431013	Nevertheless, the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity.
22431014	Among unanswered questions are whether Mr. Papandreou received $23 million of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $734,000 in bribes, as contended; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $57 million in Mr. Koskotas's bank and then skim off the interest; and, what PASOK's cut was from the $210 million Mr. Koskotas pinched.
22431015	Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court.
22431016	But eluding parliamentary probe was the case of millions of drachmas Mr. Koskotas funneled into New Democracy coffers.
22431017	In the end, the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and "indications" that point to PASOK, not clinching proof.
22431018	On another issue, Greeks were told how their national intelligence agency, the EYP, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures, including key opposition politicians, journalists and PASOK cabinet members.
22431019	Despite convincing arguments, it was never established that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps.
22431020	The central weakness of the "scandals" debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks.
22431021	The coalition government tried to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, produced by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France's Avions Marcel Dassault, respectively.
22431022	Naturally, neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected to hamper its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid (or not) to various Greek officials for services rendered.
22431023	So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter: PASOK, whether guilty or not, can now traipse the countryside condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou's expense.
22431024	But while verbal high jinks alone won't help PASOK regain power, Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated.
22431025	First came his predictable fusillade: He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece.
22431026	Then, to buttress his credibility with the left, he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner.
22431027	Next, he continued to court the communists -- many of whom feel betrayed by the left-right coalition's birth -- by bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate.
22431028	For balance, and in hopes of gaining some disaffected centrist votes, he managed to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis.
22431029	Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench, but also with "seals of approval" from representatives of its harshest accusers.
22431030	Crucial as these elections are for Greece, pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle.
22431031	The country's future NATO participation remains unsure, for instance.
22431032	Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation.
22431033	Greece's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well.
22431034	For one, the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990.
22431035	Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections, but the clock is running.
22431036	Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian terrorist who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight.
22431037	The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case, but the matter awaits final approval from Greece's next justice minister.
22431038	The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism.
22431039	That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable; the Greek press, previously eager to palm off PASOK's line, has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance.
22431040	Yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real.
22431041	If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader, he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition.
22431042	Also, he could force new elections early next year by frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March.
22431043	New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK, forgetting to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles.
22431044	As for Mr. Papandreou?
22431045	He's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage.
22431046	But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who ever raked muck, it seems far wiser to view him as sidelined, but certainly not yet eliminated.
22431047	Mr. Carpenter, a regional correspondent for National Review, has lived in Athens since 1981.
22432001	U.S. OFFICIALS MOVED to head off any repeat of Black Monday today following Friday's plunge in stock prices.
22432002	Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system to prevent a financial crisis.
22432003	Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans, though they kept their moves quiet to avoid making the financial markets more jittery.
22432004	Friday's sell-off was triggered by the collapse of UAL's buy-out plan and a big rise in producer prices.
22432005	The Dow Jones industrials skidded 190.58, to 2569.26.
22432006	The junk bond market came to a standstill, while Treasury bonds soared and the dollar fell.
22432007	Japanese stocks dropped early Monday, but by late morning were turning around.
22432008	The dollar was trading sharply lower in Tokyo.
22432009	Prospects for a new UAL buy-out proposal appear bleak.
22432010	Many banks refused to back the $6.79 billion transaction, but bankers said it was not from any unwillingness to finance takeovers.
22432011	The decision was based solely on problems with the UAL management-pilot plan, they said.
22432012	The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines, but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9% jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation.
22432013	Also, retail sales grew 0.5% last month.
22432014	A capital-gains tax cut was removed from the Senate's deficit reduction bill, but proponents still hope to enact the cut this year.
22432015	Bush won't press for a capital-gains provision in the final deficit bill when House-Senate conferees meet later this week.
22432016	General Motors signaled that up to five North American assembly plants may close by the mid-1990s as it tries to cut excess capacity.
22432017	U.S. car and truck sales fell 12.6% in early October, the first sales period of the 1990-model year, dragged down by a sharp decline in GM sales.
22432018	Warner and Sony are entangled in a legal battle over movie producers Peter Gruber and Jon Peters.
22432019	The fight could set back Sony's plans to enter the U.S. movie business.
22432020	Hooker's U.S. unit received a $409 million bid for most of its real-estate and shopping-center assets from an investor group.
22432021	The offer doesn't include Bonwit Teller or B. Altman.

22433001	A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders can't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product's flaws.
22433002	The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc., claiming that company officials misled investors about the expected success of the Lisa computer, introduced in 1983.
22433003	Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said they are concerned that use of the "press defense" by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling.
22433004	According to the suit, Apple officials created public excitement by touting Lisa as an office computer that would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year.
22433005	The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare, the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa.
22433006	The suit claimed Apple's stock climbed to a high of $63.50 a share on the basis of the company's optimistic forecasts.
22433007	But when the company revealed Lisa's poor sales late in 1983, the stock plummeted to a low of $17.37 a share, according to the suit.
22433008	The shareholders claimed more than $150 million in losses.
22433009	In 1987, the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company's statements by alerting consumers to Lisa's problems.
22433010	Late last month, the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed.
22433011	However, it gave the shareholders the right to pursue a small portion of their claim that pertains to Lisa's disk drive, known as Twiggy.
22433012	The court ruled that the news media didn't reveal Twiggy's problems at the time.
22433013	Lawyers are worried about the ruling's implication in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded as very specific to the Apple case.
22433014	"The court was careful to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles and received the same attention as the company's statements," said Patrick Grannon, a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles, which wasn't involved in the case.
22433015	"The court is saying that the adverse facts have to be transferred to the market with equal intensity and credibility as the statements of corporate insiders."
22433016	Shareholders' attorneys at the New York firm of Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Specthrie & Lerach last week petitioned for a rehearing of the case.
22433017	They wrote: "The opinion establishes a new rule of immunity -- that if a wide variety of opinions on a company's business are publicly reported, the company can say anything without fear of securities liability."
22433018	NFL ORDERED to pay $5.5 million in legal fees to defunct
22433019	The National Football League is considering appealing the ruling stemming from the U.S. Football League's largely unsuccessful antitrust suit against the NFL.
22433020	A jury in 1986 agreed with the USFL's claims that the NFL monopolized major league football.
22433021	But the jury awarded the USFL only $1 in damages, trebled because of the antitrust claims.
22433022	Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York upheld a $5.5 million award of attorneys fees to the defunct league.
22433023	Harvey D. Myerson, of Myerson & Kuhn, then of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, was the lead trial lawyer, and his new firm pursued the application appeal.
22433024	Douglas R. Pappas of Myerson & Kuhn says about $5.3 million of the award goes directly to the USFL to reimburse it for fees already paid.
22433025	Myerson & Kuhn will get about $260,000 for the costs of pressing the application.
22433026	The federal appeals court held that the nominal damages and the failure to prove all claims didn't exclude the USFL from being reimbursed.
22433027	Antitrust laws provide that injured parties may be reimbursed for lawyers' fees.
22433028	But Shepard Goldfein, an attorney for the NFL, says his client will consider asking for another hearing or appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court.
22433029	Mr. Goldfein, of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in New York, says the ruling is wrong and the fee award is excessive because the USFL lost its major claims, including its contention that the NFL restrained trade through television contracts.
22433030	"The USFL was not the prevailing party," Mr. Goldfein insists.
22433031	HOUSTON-CALGARY ALLIANCE:
22433032	Fulbright & Jaworski of Houston and Fenerty, Robertson, Fraser & Hatch of Calgary, Alberta, are affiliating to help serve their energy-industry clients.
22433033	The affiliation is believed to be the first such cross-border arrangement among major law firms.
22433034	The firms aren't required to refer work exclusively to each other and remain separate organizations.
22433035	But they will work together on energy-, environmental- and fair-trade-related issues and conduct seminars on topics of mutual interest, said Gibson Gayle Jr. of 585-lawyer Fulbright & Jaworski.
22433036	In addition, Fulbright & Jaworski's Washington, D.C., office will play a key role as the firms work together on regulatory issues, particularly natural-gas exports, for their clients.
22433037	The arrangement, reached after about eight months of negotiations, grew out of 80-lawyer Fenerty Robertson's desire to develop ties with a U.S. firm in light of relaxed trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada, said Francis M. Saville of Fenerty Robertson.
22433038	IN WHAT MAY SIGNAL a turnaround for asbestos manufacturers, W.R. Grace & Co. won a 3 1/2-week trial in Pittsburgh over whether it should be required to remove asbestos fireproofing from a local high school.
22433039	Mount Lebanon High School, near Pittsburgh, sought $21 million in compensatory damages from Grace, arguing that the asbestos, which can cause respiratory diseases and lung cancer, posed a risk to students.
22433040	Grace successfully contended that removing the fire retardant would pose a greater health risk than leaving it alone.
22433041	A spokesman for the company said the verdict is thought to be the first in favor of an asbestos manufacturer where the plaintiff was a school and the asbestos in question was used for fireproofing.
22433042	FCC COUNSEL JOINS FIRM:
22433043	Diane S. Killory will join 500-lawyer Morrison & Foerster as a partner in its Washington, D.C., office in mid-November.
22433044	She will help develop the mass-media practice of the San Francisco-based firm's communications group.
22433045	Ms. Killory, 35 years old, resigned as Federal Communications Commission general counsel early this month after nearly three years in that post.
22433046	She was the first woman to be appointed FCC general counsel.
22433047	RICHARD P. MAGURNO, formerly Eastern Airlines' top lawyer, joined the New York law firm of Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith as a partner.
22433048	Mr. Magurno, 45, spent 17 years at the Miami airline unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp. and was named general counsel in 1984.
22433049	He left the company in 1987.
22433050	Mr. Magurno said he will split his time between the 200-lawyer firm's offices in Washington, D.C., and New York, with specialties in aviation and labor law.
22434001	Apple Computer Inc. said it will offer cash rebates on several of its machines from Oct. 14 to Dec. 31., as part of a holiday-season sales promotion.
22434002	Apple will offer a $150 rebate on its Apple IIGS with any Apple Monitor and disk drive; $200 on the basic Macintosh Plus central processing unit; $250 on the Macintosh SE central processing unit; $250 on the Macintosh SE/30 cpu, and $300 on a Macintosh IIcx with any Apple video card and Apple monitor.
22434003	The rebates, as a percentage of the retail cost of the cpu of each system, amount to 6% to 13%.
22434004	The company is also offering a free trial of its computers to consumers who qualify for its credit cards or leases.
22435001	Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced they have completed a 100 million-mark ($52.2 million) joint venture to produce electronics parts.
22435002	In the venture's first fiscal year, Siemens will hold 74.9% of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary, Matsushita Electronic Components Co., 25.1%.
22435003	A basic agreement between the two companies was announced in June.
22435004	The new company is to be called Siemens Matsushita Components G.m.b.H.
22435005	It will have its headquarters in Munich.
22435006	Matsushita's share in the venture will rise to 35% Oct. 1, 1990, and to 50% the following Oct. 1.
22435007	Siemens will retain majority voting rights.
22435008	The parent companies forecast sales for the venture of around 750 million marks for its first fiscal year, Matsushita said.
22435009	Sales are expected to rise to one billion marks after four years.
22435010	The company will have production facilities in West Germany, Austria, France and Spain.
22436001	Roger Rosenblatt, editor of U.S. News & World Report, resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine.
22436002	Mr. Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine's editorial offices in Washington.
22436003	"Frankly, I missed my family," said Mr. Rosenblatt.
22436004	In Mr. Rosenblatt's tenure, the magazine's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly.
22436005	But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation, U.S. News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc.'s Time magazine, with 4.4 million circulation, and Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek, with 3.3 million circulation.
22436006	Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief, said Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby, the magazine's executive editor, and Merrill McLoughlin, a senior writer.
22436007	Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married to each other.
22436008	Mr. Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format, which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented, how-to articles.
22436009	Mr. Rosenblatt, a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U.S. News & World Report, said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor.
22436010	The offers were to work as a writer, not an editor.
22436011	He said he will now consider those offers.
22437001	Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A. said group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit-sharing soared 97% to 839 million francs ($129.6 million) in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier.
22437002	The French aircraft group pointed out, however, that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts.
22437003	It noted, for example, that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs, down about 12% from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier.
22437004	Still, it said it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs, reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year.
22437005	For all of 1988, Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs.
22437006	The group hasn't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989, nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full-year earnings.
22438001	Keystone Consolidated Industries Inc. expects to report earnings before extraordinary tax benefits of about $1.5 million, or about 41 cents a share, for the third quarter, compared with a loss last year, said Glenn R. Simmons, chairman and chief executive officer.
22438002	After a tax benefit of about $780,000, Keystone expects to report net income of $2.3 million, or about 62 cents a share, Mr. Simmons said.
22438003	For third quarter last year, Keystone reported a $1 million loss from continuing operations and a $200,000 loss from discontinued operations, for a net loss of $1.2 million.
22438004	Revenue for the latest third quarter was about $70.5 million, up 10% from $63.6 million last year, he said.
22438005	Mr. Simmons said the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products, which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of lower-priced, imported steel.
22438006	A new $46 million steel rod minimill, which got off to a rocky start in early 1988, now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing Keystone's products, Mr. Simmons said.
22438007	As a result, the company hopes to report net income for the year of about $11.6 million, or about $3.10 to $3.15 a share, compared with a net loss of $24.4 million last year, after a loss from discontinued operations of $18.4 million.
22438008	Revenue for 1989 is expected to be about $300 million, up about 21% from $247.3 million in 1988.
22438009	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Keystone expects to report net income of $9.3 milion, or about $2.53 a share, after an extraordinary gain from $3.2 million in tax benefits.
22438010	Last year, the company had a net loss of $6.5 million, including a $6.1 million loss from continuing operations and a $400,000 loss from discontinued operations.
22438011	Revenue for the nine months is expected to be about $230.5 million, up about 21% from $190.4 million last year.
22438012	Mr. Simmons said Keystone's new mill is expected to produce about 585,000 tons of steel rods this year, up from 413,000 tons in 1988.
22438013	Production at the mill has exceeded the ability of Keystone's casting operation to supply it, he said, which will force Keystone to purchase billet, or unfinished steel bars, from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year.
22438014	Keystone will have to consider expanding its casting operation, at an estimated cost of $8 million to $10 million, within the next 18 to 24 months, Mr. Simmons said.
22438015	Under Robert W. Singer, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, Keystone has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the East and West coasts.
22438016	"Prior to a year ago, Keystone was an order-taker.
22438017	Now I think we have a group of marketing people who are out selling to retailers and wholesalers," Mr. Simmons said.
22438018	Still, he said, the 100-year-old company plans to continue its premium-priced strategy for its distinctive brand of red-tipped wire fencing and other products.
22438019	The company claims a 40% share of the U.S. field fence business, a 35% share of poultry netting sales and a 30% share of barbed wire sales.
22439001	Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium-recovery facility in Donaldsonville, La., will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit.
22439002	The company didn't elaborate.
22439003	The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant, but that the plant can be reactivated quickly when the market improves.
22439004	More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced at the facility during the past seven years.
22439005	A second uranium-recovery plant at Uncle Sam, La., that produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually, will continue to operate.
22439006	Freeport-McMoRan said the shutdown won't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit, but will reduce the amount of product sold on the spot market.
22439007	Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, as owner of the uranium-recovery technology, receives royalty payments.
22440001	Business Week subscribers may hear this week's issue talking back to them.
22440002	A four-page ad from Texas Instruments Inc., running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 "Corporate Elite" issue of the McGraw-Hill Inc. publication, contains a speech synthesizer laminated between two of the pages.
22440003	Readers who pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but distinctly human-sounding -- voice announce, "I am the talking chip," as it launches into a 15-second discourse on its own attributes.
22440004	The talking chip isn't cheap -- the per-ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $4, and that's without adding in Business Week's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes it is a first.
22440005	Previous efforts have included musical ads, featuring simple tone-generating chips that play a tune, but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated, with none of the robotic flatness that one hears, for example, when calling telephone directory services.
22440006	And for those who miss the message the first time around, not to worry: Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays.
22441001	Lomas Financial Corp., Dallas, said it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Co. to help it sell its leasing unit.
22441002	Lomas, assisted by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, has been trying to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months, apparently without success.
22441003	The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt.
22441004	Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank-credit agreement, Lomas defaulted on $145 million in notes that became due Sept. 1.
22441005	It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its $1.45 billion in senior debt.
22441006	Lomas said Merrill Lynch, which owns bonds and equity in Lomas, couldn't continue as Lomas's investment banker because it is also a creditor.
22441007	It said it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard's offices in Europe and Japan, where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company.
22442001	Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it will increase its loan-loss provisions to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries, except Mexico, resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars (US$255 million).
22442002	Don Bowder, senior vice president and chief accountant, said the bank's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank to set aside provisions covering all its C$1.17 billion in non-Mexican LDC debt.
22442003	"It eliminates the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans," he said.
22442004	The bank said about C$525 million will be added to its existing LDC and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter, ending Oct. 31.
22442005	Mr. Bowder said the C$300 million charge to earnings would amount to about C$1.34 a share.
22442006	The bank's net income for the nine months ended July 31 was C$577 million, or C$3.10 a share.
22442007	Mr. Bowder said the bank will restructure its C$604 million of Mexican debt, of which C$255 million is in Mexican notes secured by U.S. government bonds.
22442008	The bank has a 45% reserve against the remaining C$349 million of Mexican debt and expects to swap that for other Mexican notes supported by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds.
22442009	Mr. Bowder said the bank's experience with LDC debt has been "painful" and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun seven years ago to reduce its exposure through provisioning, debt sales and debt swaps.
22442010	He said the bank will no longer participate in LDC sovereign lending, but will support trade financing and other transactions that meet the bank's standards.
22443001	The carnage among takeover stocks Friday doesn't mean the end of mega-mergers but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game, Wall Street's big-time deal makers say.
22443002	Suitors from now on are more likely to be expansion-minded companies, rather than raiders or debt-happy financiers.
22443003	And they will be launching lower-priced and perhaps fewer deals, now that it's tougher to finance them.
22443004	This is an ominous sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale.
22443005	Whenever the 1980s merger boom seems to be stalling, shock waves ripple through the stock market.
22443006	"The market is overvalued, not cheap," says Alan Gaines of the New York money-management firm Gaines Berland.
22443007	He recently began increasing his cash position to 45% of his portfolio.
22443008	"I look at where deals can get done," he says, "and they're not getting done" at current prices.
22443009	Lenders are growing increasingly nervous about debt-financed takeovers, investment bankers say.
22443010	"You had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that ran smack into the news on Friday about what appeared to be happening to the bank debt market," says Steven Rattner, a partner and merger specialist with Lazard Freres & Co.
22443011	Trading dried up Friday in the market for high-yield junk bonds, often used to finance takeovers.
22443012	It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market, where prices began weakening last month after Campeau hit a cash crunch.
22443013	And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans.
22443014	The group trying to buy UAL announced Friday that it couldn't arrange the $7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for $300 a share.
22443015	Takeover-stock traders today will be scrambling to learn of any UAL developments, and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in sympathy.
22443016	Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL's board spent a frantic weekend trying to hammer out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks.
22443017	After UAL, the stock viewed as most vulnerable is American Airlines' parent AMR, the target of a $120-a-share takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump.
22443018	Trading in AMR shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Friday and didn't resume.
22443019	Before the halt, AMR last traded at 98 5/8.
22443020	Late Friday night, the London office of Jefferies & Co., a Los Angeles securities firm, traded AMR shares at prices as low as 80.
22443021	Similarly, Delta Air Lines and USAir Group dropped 10.1% and 8.5%, respectively, on Friday and could weaken further.
22443022	Over the weeked, however, two developments in other deals indicated that commerical banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies.
22443023	Vitro S.A., a major Mexican glass maker, said yesterday that it agreed to buy Anchor Glass Container in a tender offer for $21.25 a share, sweetened from the original $20-a-share offer Vitro launched two months ago.
22443024	On Friday, Anchor shares fell 1 1/4 to close at 18 1/2.
22443025	For the broader market, the greatest significance of the Vitro-Anchor deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market rout -- and involves a $155 million temporary "bridge" loan from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $139 million loan from Security Pacific National Bank.
22443026	Moreover, to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt, Donaldson said it is "highly confident" that it will be able to sell $400 million of junk bonds for Vitro, despite the current disarray in the junk bond market.
22443027	Donaldson's statement isn't merely an idle boast, because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson's bridge loan can be paid back.
22443028	Security Pacific, meanwhile, said it expects to arrange $430 million in bank loans for Vitro.
22443029	In another takeover battle, a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain "highly confident" they can arrange $4.5 billion of bank loans for McCaw's tender offer for about 45% of LIN Broadcasting, "notwithstanding recent events."
22443030	McCaw is offering $125 a share for 22 million LIN shares, thereby challenging LIN's proposal to spin off its television properties, pay shareholders a $20-a-share special dividend and combine its cellular-telephone operations with BellSouth's cellular business.
22443031	On Friday, LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that didn't fall much, dropping 5 1/2, or 4.9%, to close at 107 1/2.
22443032	Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares weren't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a well-financed corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by skittishness among bankers or bond buyers.
22443033	Investment bankers interviewed over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock-market drop.
22443034	Potential bidders for companies "were saying that things were beginning to look expensive," says Mr. Rattner of Lazard.
22443035	"Nothing makes things look cheaper than a 200-point drop in the Dow," Mr. Rattner says.
22443036	"Just as there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the stock market, there are people waiting to become bargain hunters in the deal market."
22443037	Investment bankers expect most of those bargain hunters to be well-heeled corporations.
22443038	"In the past, corporate buyers were often discouraged from making bids because of competition from LBO firms, which were often prepared to outbid" the corporations, says J. Tomilson Hill, head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
22443039	Now, "corporate buyers should be willing to re-enter the acquisition market because the competition from junkbond-financed buyers has been reduced."
22443040	Many takeover stocks plunged Friday, as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the socalled whisper stocks, the targets of rumored deals.
22443041	Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which has agreed to a friendly $27-a-share bid from Sony of Japan, fell only 1/8 to close at 26 5/8.
22443042	But several stocks long rumored to be ripe for a takeover or restructuring fell 10% or more.
22443043	They include USX, down 11.7%; Upjohn, down 11.1%; Campbell Soup, down 11%; Paramount Communications, off 10.3%; Woolworth, down 10.2%; Delta Air Lines, down 10.1%, and MCA, down 9.7%.
22443044	The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less sanguine about companies that have had at least one bid, merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already.
22443045	Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market, traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again.
22443046	Examples include Kollmorgen, whose agreement to be acquired for $25 a share by Vernitron collapsed last month.
22443047	Kollmorgen shares fell nearly 20% on Friday to close at 12 7/8.
22443048	Ramada, which first delayed and then shelved a $400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring, fell 15.6% to close at 9 1/2.
22443049	Ramada has said it hopes to propose a new restructuring plan but hasn't indicated when it will do so.
22443050	Shares of American Medical International, which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago, fell 15.8% on Friday to close at 20.
22443051	The buy-out group is offering $26.50 a share for 63 million American Medical shares, down from its offer in July of $28 a share for 68.8 million shares.
22443052	But investment bankers say the market may have oversold some takeover-related stocks.
22443053	Hilton Hotels, for example, was among the worst-hit issues, falling 20.2% to close at 85, down 21 1/2 on Friday.
22443054	Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses.
22443055	People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing.
22443056	However, they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness among banks to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers.
22443057	Hilton officials said they weren't worried about the drop in the company's stock.
22443058	William Lebo, Hilton's general counsel, said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are "on track" for what has been described previously as "a slow and deliberate process."
22443059	"I can't believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected by one day's trading," Mr. Lebo said.
22443060	But the stock market as a whole, bolstered as it is by takeover speculation, remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers, both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks.
22443061	For debt-ridden suitors, "the takeover game has been over for some time," says New York money manager Neil Weisman of Chilmark Capital, who has been keeping 85% of his portfolio in cash.
22443062	"The market is just waking up to that point."

22444001	Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm, few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease.
22444002	To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment, however, the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms.
22444003	It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective.
22444004	Specifically, it must understand how real-estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities.
22444005	When a regional economy catches cold, the local real-estate market gets pneumonia.
22444006	In other words, real-estate market indicators, such as building permits and leasing activity, plummet much further than a local economy in recession.
22444007	This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York.
22444008	But the reverse is also true: When a region's economy rebounds from a slowdown, these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy.
22444009	Why do local real-estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles?
22444010	Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth.
22444011	Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s, as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment.
22444012	Area employment dropped by 13% from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14%.
22444013	However, the real-estate market was hurt even more.
22444014	For example, residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76% from the 1979 peak level.
22444015	Once metropolitan Detroit's economy rallied in the mid-1980s, real estate rebounded.
22444016	Building permits, for example, soared a staggering 400% between 1982 and the peak year of 1986.
22444017	Where, savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking, are today's opportunities?
22444018	Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver, two of the most depressed, overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation.
22444019	Of course, some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play.
22444020	But now appears to be the time to act.
22444021	Metropolitan Houston's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak.
22444022	In the mid-1980s, employment was down as much as 5% from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13%.
22444023	The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks.
22444024	Office construction dropped 97%.
22444025	The vacancy rate soared more than 20% in nearly every product category, and more than 30% of office space was vacant.
22444026	To some observers, the empty office buildings of Houston's "see-through skyline" were indicative of a very troubled economy.
22444027	As usual, the real-estate market had overreacted.
22444028	Actually, the region's economy retained a firm foundation.
22444029	Metropolitan Houston's population has held steady over the past six years.
22444030	And personal income, after slumping in the mid-1980s, has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms.
22444031	Today, metropolitan Houston's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround.
22444032	More than 42,000 jobs were added in metro Houston last year, primarily in biotechnology, petrochemical processing, and the computer industry.
22444033	This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year.
22444034	And forecasts project a 2.5% to 3% growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average.
22444035	Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has overreacted to the region's economic trends, although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston.
22444036	By some measures, metropolitan Denver's economy has actually improved in the past four years.
22444037	Its population has continued to increase since 1983, the peak year of the economic cycle.
22444038	Employment is now 4% higher than in 1983.
22444039	Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15% between 1983 and 1987 (the most recent year available).
22444040	The rates of increase, however, are less than the rapid growth of the boom years, and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy.
22444041	In a self-fulfilling prophecy, therefore, the region's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years.
22444042	Housing building permits are down more than 75% from their 1983 peaks.
22444043	Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver's real-estate market will rebound, major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center, a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area, and a new regional airport.
22444044	When Denver's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return, and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound.
22444045	What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston's or Denver's?
22444046	Generally, overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak, even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington, New York and Los Angeles.
22444047	Vacancy rates in the 15% to 19% range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20% range in a couple of years.
22444048	Under these conditions, even a flattening out of economic growth -- "catching cold" -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia.
22444049	Those looking for real-estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term (three-year) lease and wait for the bargains ahead.
22444050	Mr. Leinberger is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
22445001	Kysor Industrial Corp. said it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents a share, compared with 61 cents a share a year ago.
22445002	Analysts had been projecting that the company's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents a share.
22445003	The year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $4.1 million.
22445004	The company said a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine-related operations.
22445005	Also, the company said its commercial products operation failed to meet forecasts.
22445006	Kysor, a maker of heavy-duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment, said it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels, which are between 30 cents and 50 cents a share.
22446001	Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department to investigate $1 million in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who interceded with thrift-industry regulators for him.
22446002	Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $1.1 billion federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of bleeding off assets of a California thrift he controlled, Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and driving it into insolvency.
22446003	Fred Wertheimer -- president of Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby -- said Mr. Keating already has conceded attempting to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
22446004	Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that was quoted in a Wall Street Journal story in April: "One question . . . had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause.
22446005	I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so."
22446006	In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini's office in April 1987, the five senators asked federal regulators to ease up on Lincoln.
22446007	According to notes taken by one of the participants at the meeting, the regulators said Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors' federally insured money and was "a ticking time bomb."
22446008	Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous.
22446009	The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's regulations "grossly unfair," and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating's thrift was "viable and profitable."
22446010	For the next two years, the Bank Board, which at the time was the agency responsible for regulating thrifts, failed to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent.
22446011	Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13, and regulators seized the thrift the next day.
22446012	The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp., successor to the Bank Board, filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15.
22446013	Mr. Keating has filed his own suit, alleging that his property was taken illegally.
22446014	The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln's collapse has been estimated at as much as $2.5 billion.
22446015	Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years, mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers.
22446016	In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign, Sen. Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, returned $76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators.
22446017	Sen. DeConcini, after months of fending off intense press criticism, returned $48,000 only last month, shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of defrauding Lincoln.
22446018	In addition, Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating's vacation home at Cat Cay, the Bahamas, from 1984 through 1986.
22446019	Sen. McCain said he had meant to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter "fell between the cracks."
22446020	Mr. Keating, his family members and associates also donated $112,000 to Sen. McCain's congressional campaigns over the years, according to press accounts.
22446021	But Sen. McCain says Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987, because the senator refused to press the thrift executive's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted.
22446022	"He became very angry at that, left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp," Sen. McCain recalls.
22446023	In July, California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston, who conceded that soliciting the money was "a pretty stupid thing to do politically."
22446024	In addition, Sen. Cranston received $47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating, and the California Democratic party received $85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator's re-election campaign that year.
22446025	Also in July, Ohio newspapers disclosed $200,000 in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy, a political committee controlled by Sen. Glenn.
22446026	That was in addition to $34,000 in direct campaign donations arranged by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator.
22446027	Mr. Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel to conduct an investigation, as was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright.
22446028	Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics panel, wouldn't comment.
22446029	Sen. Riegle said he would cooperate with any inquiry, but that his conduct had been "entirely proper."
22446030	Sen. McCain said he had been "deeply concerned" at the time of the meeting that it might seem to be improper, but decided it was "entirely appropriate" for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent.
22446031	Sen. Glenn said he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and "I am completely satisfied to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee."
22446032	Sen. DeConcini said, "When all is said and done, I expect to be fully exonerated."
22446033	Sen. Cranston, who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating, portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act.
22446034	"Why didn't the Bank Board act sooner?" he said.
22446035	"That is what Common Cause should ask be investigated.
22447001	Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corp.
22447002	Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $40 million.
22447003	Trinity said it plans to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990.
22447004	It said the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the 1,450 coal rail cars presently being produced for Norfolk Southern, a Norfolk, Va.-based railroad concern.
22448001	When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979, toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first to march in.
22448002	Today, with about 75% of the companies' products being made in China, the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council, Dennis Ting, has suggested a new sourcing label: "Made in China by Hong Kong Companies."
22448003	The toy makers were pushed across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony.
22448004	But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4, the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China.
22448005	Although the manufacturers stress that production hasn't been affected by China's political turmoil, they are looking for additional sites.
22448006	The toy makers, and their foreign buyers, cite uncertainty about China's economic and political policies.
22448007	"Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket," says David Yeh, chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd.
22448008	Indeed, Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, long before the massacre.
22448009	Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China.
22448010	By diversifying supply sources, the toy makers don't intend to withdraw from China, manufacturers and foreign buyers say.
22448011	It wouldn't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade.
22448012	A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong's port, airport, banks and support industries, such as printing companies, have made China's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site.
22448013	"South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world," says Henry Hu, executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd.
22448014	Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers' reliance on factories across the border.
22448015	In 1988, exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19% from 1987, to HK$10.05 billion (US$1.29 billion).
22448016	But re-exports, mainly from China, jumped 75%, to HK$15.92 billion.
22448017	In 1989's first seven months, domestic exports fell 29%, to HK$3.87 billion, while re-exports rose 56%, to HK$11.28 billion.
22448018	Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China, where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry.
22448019	"For the next few years, like it or not, China is going to be the main supplier," says Edmund Young, vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd., one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border.
22448020	In the meantime, as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites, they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia.
22448021	Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand, including Matchbox, Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co., the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting.
22448022	Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied.
22448023	With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992, several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain, Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites.
22448024	Worries about China came just as Hong Kong's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies, Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc.
22448025	Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry, causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management.
22448026	The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results.
22448027	Still, they long for a "mega-hit" toy to excite retail sales in the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest market for toys and games.
22448028	The closest thing the colony's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd.
22448029	Introduced in mid-1988, the 15-centimeter-tall plastic turtles are based on an American comic book and television series.
22448031	Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. retail toy sales, Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates.
22448032	Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988.
22448033	Besides the lack of a fast-selling product, they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System, an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan.
22448034	Nintendo buyers have little money left to spend on other products.
22448035	Many of the toy makers' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing's austerity programs launched late last year.
22448036	Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months, down from five days a week, as the province's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity.
22448037	Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants.
22448038	Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4.
22448039	Also, concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong, which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms.
22448040	But, toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern China.
22448041	They say China's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong.
22448042	"The Chinese leaders have to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports," says Mr. Kwan of Playmates.
22449001	The Bush administration, urging the Supreme Court to give states more leeway to restrict abortions, said minors haven't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents.
22449002	Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, recognizing a constitutional right to abortion, was incorrect.
22449003	He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that minors have a right to abortion that can't be absolutely vetoed by their parents.
22449004	The administration's position was outlined in a friend-of-the-court brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term.
22449005	The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion.
22449006	The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions.
22449007	Under that standard, which garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices, a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a "reasonable" justification for adopting it.
22449008	That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court's test since 1973, which requires a state to have a "compelling" reason for restricting abortion.
22449009	On the provisions of the Minnesota law, the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation, and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows minors to go to court for a judge's permission instead.
22449010	The case, Hodgson vs. Minnesota, will be argued Nov. 29.
22450001	Aluminum Co. of America, hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas, said net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2% to $219 million, or $2.46 a share.
22450002	The nation's No. 1 aluminum maker earned $226.3 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier.
22450003	Revenue rose 11% to $2.83 billion from $2.56 billion.
22450004	Analysts, who were expecting Alcoa to post around $2.70 to $3 a share, were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results.
22450005	"It's disappointing," said William Siedenburg, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
22450006	Much of the earnings decline was led by currency-exchange rate adjustments, which affected the bottom line by $15.3 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $3.6 million, or four cents a share, the previous year.
22450007	Lower prices for aluminum ingots and certain alloy products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings, the company said.
22450008	"In addition, costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant outages for modernization work," the company said.
22450009	Excluding the higher tax rate, which rose two percentage points to 38%, and the negative exchange rate adjustment, the company would have met analysts' expectations, said R. Wayne Atwell, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
22450010	Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry's slowest, Mr. Atwell added, "the third quarter is never a bang up period for them anyway."
22450011	Nevertheless, the company said shipments were up slightly to 679,000 metric tons from 671,000, buffing the impact of the unexpected earning decline.
22450012	The results were announced after the stock market closed.
22450013	In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Alcoa closed at $72 a share, down $4.75, in a sharply lower market.
22451001	For 20 years, federal rules have barred the three major television networks from sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business.
22451002	And for six years, NBC, ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt to change that.
22451003	But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios, the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever.
22451004	They hope the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress to push for ending federal rules that prohibit the networks from grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows they put on the air.
22451005	Even network executives, however, admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon.
22451006	And so the networks also are pushing for new ways to sidestep the "fin-syn" provisions, known formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules.
22451007	That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co., backed by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co., had tried to help fund Qintex Australia Ltd.'s now-scuttled $1.5 billion bid for MGM/UA Communications Co.
22451008	NBC's interest may revive the deal, which MGM/UA killed last week when the Australian concern had trouble raising cash.
22451009	Even if that deal isn't revived, NBC hopes to find another.
22451010	"Our doors are open," an NBC spokesman says.
22451011	NBC may yet find a way to take a passive, minority interest in a program-maker without violating the rules.
22451012	And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC's parent, Capital Cities/ABC Inc., to look for ways of skirting the fin-syn regulations.
22451013	But the networks' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios.
22451014	Both sides are to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on reducing fin-syn restraints.
22451015	Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge.
22451016	The networks still are "uninhibited in their authority" over what shows get on the air, charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti, the most vociferous opponent of rescinding the rules.
22451017	Studios are "powerless" to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough to go into lucrative rerun sales, he contends.
22451018	And that's why the rules, for the most part, must stay in place, he says.
22451019	Studio executives in on the talks-including officials at Paramount Communications Inc., Fries Entertainment Inc., Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined to be interviewed.
22451020	But Mr. Valenti, who represents the studios, asserts: "The whole production industry, to a man, is on the side of preserving" the rules.
22451021	Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend.
22451022	"They don't seem to have an incentive to negotiate," says one network executive.
22451023	"And there's no indication that Washington is prepared to address the rules.
22451024	That's the problem, isn't it?"
22451025	Indeed it is.
22451026	Congress has said repeatedly it wants no part of the mess, urging the studios and the networks, which license rights to air shows made by the studios, to work out their own compromise.
22451027	But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright, in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive.
22451028	The latest provocation: Sony Corp.'s plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4 billion, and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million.
22451029	"I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think of the Sony/Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast exclusively from Tokyo," wrote J.B. Holston, an NBC vice president, in a commentary in last week's issue of Broadcasting magazine.
22451030	In his article, Mr. Holston, who was in Europe last week and unavailable, complained that the "archaic restraints" in fin-syn rules have "contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises.
22451031	" (He didn't mention that NBC, in the meantime, was hoping to assist Australia's Qintex in buying
22451032	An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston's lament was "entirely consistent" with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be "light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks."
22451033	The Big Three's drumbeat for deregulation began intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner.
22451034	Although Time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from Warner, the merger will let Time's largely unregulated pay-cable channel, Home Box Office, own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a vertical integration that is effectively blocked by fin-syn regulations.
22451035	NBC's Mr. Wright led the way in decrying the networks' inability to match a Time-Warner combination.
22451036	He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced.
22451037	Since NBC's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM/UA was disclosed, Mr. Wright hasn't been available for comment.
22451038	With a Qintex deal, NBC would move into uncharted territory -- possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington.
22451039	"It's never really been tested," says William Lilley III, who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted.
22451040	He now runs Policy Communications in Washington, consulting to media companies.
22451041	Fin-syn rules don't explicitly block a network from buying a passive, small stake in a company that profits from the rerun syndication networks can't enjoy.
22451042	Hence, NBC might be able to take, say, a 5% stake in a company such as MGM/UA.
22451043	If the transaction raised objections, the studio's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network doesn't have a direct stake.
22451044	But such convolutions would still block the networks from grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication.
22451045	Under current rules, even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC, for example, made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime/comedy "Moonlighting" -- it isn't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations.
22451046	Instead, ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee.
22451047	The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are slim -- for several years at the least.
22451048	Six years ago they were tantalizingly close.
22451049	The Reagan-era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules.
22451050	Various evidence, including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s, showed the networks didn't wield undue control over the studios as had been alleged.
22451051	But just eight days before the rules were to die, former President Ronald Reagan, a one-time actor, intervened on behalf of Hollywood.
22451052	The FCC effort collapsed.
22451053	The networks and studios have bickered ever since.
22451054	Network officials involved in the studio talks may hope the foreign influx builds more support in Washington, but that seems unlikely.
22451055	In Congress, the issue falters: It's about money, not program quality, and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue.
22451056	A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who heads a subcommittee that oversees the FCC, says Mr. Markey feels "the world has been forever changed by the Sony-Columbia deal."
22451057	But he said Mr. Markey hopes this pushes the networks and studios to work it out on their own.
22451058	And at the FCC, meanwhile, new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan.
22452001	Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a civil action filed against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service.
22452002	The government sued the company in April, seeking $23,000 and other unspecified damages related to an alleged contract-steering scheme.
22452003	The suit named the company, former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr., former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who weren't part of the company.
22452004	The suit charged the defendants with causing Peter E. Voss, an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors, to accept $23,000 in bribes, kickbacks and gratuities.
22452005	Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $11,000 for his role in the scheme.
22452006	In the agreement, Recognition agreed to pay the government $20,000 in return for the release of all claims against the company, Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy.
22452007	The five additional defendants weren't parties to the settlement.
22452008	A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia.
22452009	They were indicted last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related to an effort to win $400 million in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment.
22452010	The company and its executives deny the charges.
22452011	In a related development, Recognition Equipment said the Postal Service has barred the company from bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days.
22452012	The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7, 1988, and has been renewing the ban ever since.
22452013	The company said it will continue to pursue a lifting of the suspension.
22453001	Intel Corp. reported a 50% drop in third-quarter net income, partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations.
22453002	The big semiconductor and computer maker, said it had net of $72 million, or 38 cents, down 50% from $142.7 million, or 78 cents a share.
22453003	The lower net included a charge of $35 million, equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis, for the cost of abandoning a computer-systems joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany.
22453004	Earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing microchip demand.
22453005	Sales amounted to $771.4 million, down 1.7% from $784.9 million.
22453006	Intel's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday, as investors appeared relieved that the company's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter's earnings of $99.3 million, or 53 cents a share, and that sales actually exceeded the $747.3 million for the second period.
22453007	But Intel later succumbed to the stock market's plunge, closing at $31.75, down $2.125.
22453008	In August, Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be "flat to down" from the previous period's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor, start-up costs associated with a line of computers and costs of preparing for mass shipments of the company's new 80486 chip in the current quarter.
22453009	On Friday, Andrew S.Grove, Intel president and chief executive officer, said "Intel's business is strong.
22453010	Our bookings improved as the quarter progressed and September was especially good.
22453011	For the full quarter, our bookings were higher than the previous quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.0."
22453012	For the nine-month period, Intel reported net of $268.3 million, or $1.43 a share, down 27% from $367.1 million, or $2.05 a share.
22453013	Revenue amounted to $2.23 billion, up slightly from $2.15 billion.
22454001	Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday.
22454002	After 26 years in prison, Mr. Sisulu, the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement, was dropped off at his house by a prison services' van just as the sun was coming up.
22454003	At the same time, six ANC colleagues, five of whom were arrested with him in 1963 and sentenced to life imprisonment, were reunited with their families at various places around the country.
22454004	And as the graying men returned to their homes, the ANC, outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government, defiantly returned to the streets of the country's black townships.
22454005	A huge ANC flag, with black, green and gold stripes, was hoisted over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu's modest house, while on the street out front, boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts, caps and scarves.
22454006	At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi, a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped in ANC ribbons.
22454007	"I am happy to see the spirit of the people," said Mr. Sisulu, looking dapper in a new gray suit.
22454008	As the crowd outside his home shouted "ANC, ANC," the old man shot his fists into the air.
22454009	"I'm inspired by the mood of the people."
22454010	Under the laws of the land, the ANC remains an illegal organization, and its headquarters are still in Lusaka, Zambia.
22454011	But the unconditional release of the seven leaders, who once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC, is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing.
22454012	"The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again," said Cassim Saloojee, a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu.
22454013	"Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now.
22454014	There's no turning back."
22454015	There was certainly no stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night, when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years.
22454016	Deafening chants of "ANC" and "Umkhonto we Sizwe" shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts, including the armed struggle.
22454017	And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela, the ANC's leading figure, who was jailed with them and remains in prison.
22454018	Without him, said Mr. Sisulu, the freeing of the others "is only a half-measure."
22454019	President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government.
22454020	But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country.
22454021	As other repressive governments, particularly Poland and the Soviet Union, have recently discovered, initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult, if not impossible, to control.
22454022	As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency.
22454023	If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest.
22454024	If it does, the large number of right-wing whites, who oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats to take matters into their own hands.
22454025	The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure.
22454026	The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence; if it does, Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars.
22454027	Pretoria hasn't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place: for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
22454028	In addition, the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment.
22454029	In order to head off any divisions, Mr. Mandela, in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released, instructed them to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible.
22454030	The men also will be faced with bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country's many militant black youths, the so-called young lions who are anxious to see the old lions in action.
22454031	Says Peter Mokaba, president of the South African Youth Congress: "We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC."
22454032	They never considered themselves to be anything else.
22454033	At last night's rally, they called on their followers to be firm, yet disciplined, in their opposition to apartheid.
22454034	"We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very, very sensitive," said Andrew Mlangeni, another early Umkhonto leader who is now 63.
22454035	"We want to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison, and if we aren't disciplined we may not see them here with us.
